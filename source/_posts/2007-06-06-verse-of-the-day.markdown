_Proverbs 23:19  
Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way._

What did James, the half-brother of Jesus, tell us to be? "Swift to
hear, slow to speak..." "Hear thou" the preacher exhorts. Dear
believer, God is speaking, are you listening. He is speaking through
His Word; He is speaking through His Spirit and His Word; He is
speaking through prayer and His Spirit and His Word; and He is
speaking through His church and preacher and prayer and His Spirit
and His Word. Stop, look and listen.
