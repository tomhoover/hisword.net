title: June 2nd - Extreme Love...rejoices in truth.

_II Corinthians 13:8  
For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth._

Chuck Colson said, /"The greatest friend of truth is time, her
greatest enemy is prejudice, and her constant companion is
humility."/ TRUTH is always revealed with time. Unfortunately there
can be a lot of damage to a life before the heart is humble and the
TRUTH takes hold. Have you embraced the TRUTH found in His Word?
Don't fight God. He always wins! Life is too short to argue!
