title: September 20th - Extreme Love...endures through trials.
---

_Psalm 62:7  
In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my
refuge, is in God._

There will always be days of sorrow in your life, but with God as
your hope, the strength sorrow has in your life weakens it's grasp
upon you. The strength that comes from God endures to this present
generation. The question you are left with is this: "Do you daily
embrace your God as the source of your strength?"
