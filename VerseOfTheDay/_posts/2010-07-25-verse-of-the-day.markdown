_Isaiah 32:18  
And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure
dwellings, and in quiet resting places._

Peace and quiet! We all love a little peace and quiet from time to
time. But where? How? In our connected culture, it's becoming harder
and harder to escape all the noise. The solution is not so much a
place, but a person. God can connect with you anywhere, anytime you
are ready. Take a moment in your busy, noisy day to connect with God.
Focus on a passage of Scripture that speaks to your heart and breathe
His name. You might be surprised how powerful and refreshing this
"mini vacation" can be!
