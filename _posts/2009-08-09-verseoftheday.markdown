title: August 9th - Partnership with God for a Changed Life
---

_Psalm 31:15  
My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies
and from them that persecute me._

The length of life for everyone upon this earth is held in God's
hand. It doesn't matter how old you are, what matters is that you
make the most of every day! Ask God to help you live and give your
best for Him today!
