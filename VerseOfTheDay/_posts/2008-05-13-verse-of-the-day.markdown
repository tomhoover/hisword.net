_Romans 12:21  
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good._

Victory has many faces. There will be times when you do good in the
face of evil, and it seems like no one even notices. Be assured that
God knows when you are good to the unlovely, and in His eyes there is
victory, when you leave vengeance to Him. When you do what God tells
you, the victory banner is waving.
