_Psalm 32:8  
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go:
I will guide thee with mine eye._

If you are one of those shy people, who finds yourself never
knowing what to say to others, be encouraged. God says that He will
partner with you to help you know what to say, if you will but call
upon Him. Sorry, there are "no excuses!" You can do it with God's
help!
