_John 15:13  
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for
his friends._

This is the "love" month. Are you tired of loving people? It's
easier to love people who are easy to love. Think about someone you
think is hard to love. Take the challenge to be a friend to them and
show God's love.
