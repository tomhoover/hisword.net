_Psalm 119:11  
Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against
thee._

Do you connect with God through His Word every day? There is
nothing that can take the place of reading your Bible and letting Him
speak to you through His written Word. This opening up of your heart
to God is a daily protection against the evil things that will cross
your path. You can't afford to miss your time with God.
