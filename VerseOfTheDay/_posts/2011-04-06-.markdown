_Isaiah 40:29  
He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he
increaseth strength._

Have you noticed how that sometimes when you are in crisis, you
"think" to pray, and at other times you don't? After a victory, you
can easily forget God, and resort to your own abilities. POWER to
live the Christian life only comes in "daily" allocations. Therefore,
every day you need to declare your dependence upon the mighty God. May
this be your prayer today: "Lord, I&rsquo;m weak today, and I can't go
it alone, I need Your POWER!!"
