_II Timothy 1:7  
For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
love, and of a sound mind._

We are given some APPS for FAITH in our verse today. You can
download God's power, God's love, and God's knowledge! If you do
this, it will delete FEAR! Turn on your power source through prayer
and ask God to make the download into your life. Ask Him to give you
a conscious awareness of His POWER, LOVE, and KNOWLEDGE in your life
today!
