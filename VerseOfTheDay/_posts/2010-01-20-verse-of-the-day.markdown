_Galatians 6:14  
But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
world._

The cross upon which Jesus Christ died, was like no other! Others
have been crucified on crosses, but the others didn't bear all the
sins of the world upon their cross. Jesus, having an EXTREME LOVE for
you, made the EXTREME sacrifice. These words upon this page, are
probably so common, they cease to move you, unless you should feel
the weight of sin in your own life. Imagine living with guilt, fear,
anger and despair, as it grows heavier in your life every day. It is
this thought that makes us glory in His cross. Forgiveness! Thank
you, Jesus, for bearing Your cross!
