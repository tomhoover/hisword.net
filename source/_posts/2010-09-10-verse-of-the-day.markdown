_Exodus 15:2  
The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he
is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and
I will exalt him._

When was the last time you took a whole five minutes to do nothing
but praise the LORD or sing Him a song? His EXTREME LOVE endures
forever, and you are a recipient of it! You walk in the benefits of
that position in Christ every day. Surely you aren't too busy to give
the LORD a whole five minutes! It will make you have a better day!
It's a promise!
