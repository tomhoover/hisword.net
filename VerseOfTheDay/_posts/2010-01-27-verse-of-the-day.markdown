_Romans 13:8  
Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth
another hath fulfilled the law._

If you did nothing but show LOVE to God and others, you will have
fulfilled God's commandments for your life. This sounds like a simple
thing to do, but it will require dedication and endurance. If you
don't do this, according to this verse, you will find yourself in
debt! Nobody likes to be in debt to someone, if they can do something
about it. Therefore go out and LOVE GOD and OTHERS in your world,
today! Love is a debt that will forever be a part of your life! It
will never be fully repaid.
