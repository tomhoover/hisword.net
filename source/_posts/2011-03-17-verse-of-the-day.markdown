_Hebrews 11:24-25  
By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the
son of Pharaoh's daughter; Choosing rather to suffer affliction with
the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season._

FAITH takes a different direction in our verse today. FAITH denies
the present pleasures of this world to identify itself with God.
Moses could have played both sides. Many argue that he could have
used his connection with Pharaoh's daughter as a platform to
represent his God. Moses, knowing his fleshly tendencies, understood
that it must be all or nothing with God. He would be REAL and take
his stand with God instead of embracing the wealth and security of
Egypt. REAL FAITH is willing to suffer personal loss to identify with
God's people.
