_II Corinthians 4:6  
For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath
shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory
of God in the face of Jesus Christ._

The first LIGHT of creation was a precursor to the LIGHT of Jesus
Christ. This LIGHT would be a constant reminder of the promise of a
Messiah who would come to save those who would put their FAITH and
TRUST in Him. Has this LIGHT shined in your heart? If it has, truly
make this day, Jesus' birthday. Give Him the gift of yourself!
