_Psalm 130:6  
My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the
morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning._

There is something exciting about the morning time. It pictures a
new beginning for a fresh day. No two days will ever be exactly the
same upon this earth, as your circumstances change and you change.
Therefore every day is filled with adventure and excitement to see
what God is going to do. May every morning bring you a "fresh
awareness" of God's involvement in your life.
