_II Corinthians 4:8-9  
8 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are
perplexed, but not in despair;  
9 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed._

When you are seemingly down to nothing, God is up to something! It
may seem that everything isn't going the way you want it to, but God
will never allow HOPE to be taken from you. The only way personal
hope will disappear is if your FAITH is weak! Exercise your FAITH,
and celebrate hope that can never be destroyed because of a faithful
God!
