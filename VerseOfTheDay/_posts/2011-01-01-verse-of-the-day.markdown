_Philippians 3:13  
Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing
I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth
unto those things which are before._

It's called a "new beginning!" There is something special about the
first day of the year. You are to put the past year behind you, and
set your focus upon a fresh new start. Have you spent some time with
God lately and asked Him what He wants for you this new year? Don't
be aimless! Do something that will require you to stretch your FAITH
in 2011! God has some exciting things for those who will dare trust
their life to Him!
