_Jeremiah 7:23  
But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will
be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways
that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you._

Have you taken the time to listen to God today? If you make the
time to read your Bible, He will give you some awesome nuggets of
wisdom and instructions that could change the course of your day. God
has the care of the whole world, but He's never too busy to spend time
with you!
