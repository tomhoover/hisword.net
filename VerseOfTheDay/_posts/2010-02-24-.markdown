title: February 24th - Extreme Love...is gracious, not rude.
---

_I Peter 2:23  
Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he
threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth
righteously._

There are occasions when all of us are treated rudely by others.
After several times of being treated badly, the natural tendency is
to give it back. After all, you deserve to be treated right. Our Lord
Jesus Christ experienced similar situations, and he did not strike
back at those that hurt him and were rude to him. Instead, He gave it
to God the Father to judge. Pray and ask your Father to help you have
a proper perspective on injustice and unfair treatment in your life.
Then go out and enjoy being a child of the King!
