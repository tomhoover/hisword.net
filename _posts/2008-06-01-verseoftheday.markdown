title: June 1st - God&rsquo;s Place of Peace
---

_Numbers 6:24-26  
24 The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:  
25 The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:  
26 The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace._

These verses make up a well known prayer of blessing that is often
shared among friends. In the Hebrew, each time the word
&ldquo;Lord&rdquo; is used there is a different accent in the
original, showing the distinction of the Godhead. God the Father
blesses us with Jesus; Jesus Christ is gracious unto sinners,
forgiving sin; and as a result of our accepting Jesus&rsquo; work,
the Holy Spirit brings peace into our lives. Do you see how each
works together to bring peace? Do you need to share how God brings
&ldquo;Real Peace&rdquo; with a friend?
