title: September 18th - Extreme Love...endures through trials.
---

_II Samuel 22:29  
For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my
darkness._

Did you hear David's hope and confidence in "his" God in our verse?
You can't mistake it! His personal relationship with the Almighty God
gave him a positive perspective during the dark moments of his life.
From a young age David had trials, and those trials followed him to
his death bed. He learned that his LORD's EXTREME LOVE always gave
him HOPE. Have you talked with your Savior today?
