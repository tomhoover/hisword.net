_Proverbs 3:26  
For the Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from
being taken._

When was the last time you thanked God for protecting you? This is
just one of the many blessings that you can take for granted every
day. Take time to celebrate the confidence you can have in God's care
for you!
