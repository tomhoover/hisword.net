_Hebrews 2:9  
But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for
the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the
grace of God should taste death for every man._

Are you putting away all your Christmas things today? Don't put
away Jesus. His life was more than a manger scene. His crowning
moment, the cross and resurrection, must be a part of your life
TODAY!
