_Matthew 19:19  
Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself._

Jesus spoke these words to the rich young ruler to expose his
imperfection in loving people. There will always be a challenging
relationship in your life, where you will need God's partnering help,
if you are to be victorious. Ask God to help you set aside your
selfish interests, and love all people right where they are.
