title: February 1st - Partnership with God in Loving Relationships
---

_I John 3:24  
And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him.
And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath
given us._

Since the source for all love is God, you can be sure that it will
be His love that makes for the best relationships. If you, as a
Christian, will do your part to love even the difficult people, God's
Spirit will partner with you in the lives of others to work the
miracle, that only He can bring. Make "love" your theme for today!
