_Psalm 90:2  
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed
the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou
art God._

God promises to be with us until the end of the earth and
throughout eternity. How can you put a value upon that promise? You
can show the value of this promise by including Him in all your plans
today!
