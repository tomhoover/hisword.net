title: January 11th - Extreme Love...Is not proud or self-focused
---

_Romans 14:9  
For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he
might be Lord both of the dead and living._

Are you working on some new year resolutions? Well you don't have
to go it alone. The Lord Jesus Christ is alive today and wants to
help you to become more like Him. It is through Him, that the power
to change is possible. Take a minute to renew your resolve and to
embrace the challenge to love God and others more. Extreme love will
bring about extreme change!
