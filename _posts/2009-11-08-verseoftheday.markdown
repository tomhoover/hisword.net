title: November 8th - Extreme Love...Is Kind
---

_Psalm 48:9  
We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy
temple._

It's Sunday! If you are going to have a good day at church, it will
be because you have prepared your own heart. Ask God to help keep you
focused upon Him, as you sing and worship today. It's because of
God's lovingkindness that you have breath and strength to do any and
everything. Have you thanked Him lately?
