_Isaiah 49:10  
They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun
smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by
the springs of water shall he guide them._

This is reminiscent of Jesus as the Good Shepherd in John chapter
ten. The hazardous, rocky, and dry terrain of the shepherds of the
middle east typify the spiritual hazards of life here on earth. Jesus
as the Good Shepherd will lead and guide us to the springs of water,
all the while strengthening our relationship with Him, and it is that
relationship which is our greatest source of joy and strength in this
world.
