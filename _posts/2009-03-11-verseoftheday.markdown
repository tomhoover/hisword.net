title: March 11th - Partnership with God to Touch Lives
---

_Romans 8:6  
For to be carnally minded is death: but to be spiritually minded is
life and peace._

Chances are, before you got out of bed today, you were already
planning what you were going to do. God made your mind to function at
its best, when you obey His commandments. Purpose to please God today
and you'll find the peace of His presence.
