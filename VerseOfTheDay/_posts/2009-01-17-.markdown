title: January 17th - Partnership with God in Daily Disciplines

_Hebrews 6:12  
That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and
patience inherit the promises._

Faithfulness is a requirement for most of our jobs. If you don't
show up, you don't get paid. Why is it that Christians think that
just because they aren't getting a monetary paycheck, they don't have
to be faithful to their commitments to serve the Lord? God wants to
bless you today, help Him out and do your part today.
