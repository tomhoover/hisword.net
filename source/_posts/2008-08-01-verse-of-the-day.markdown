_Deuteronomy 7:9  
Know therefore that the Lord thy God, He is God, the faithful God,
which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him, and keep
His commandments to a thousand generations._

When someone is faithful, it means they are worthy of trust and
they are reliable. God has kept every promise He has ever made to
mankind. He is as reliable today as He was in the days of Adam and
Eve. God wants to connect with you today, and see proof of your
faithfulness to Him.
