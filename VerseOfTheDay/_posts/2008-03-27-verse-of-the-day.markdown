_Romans 5:11  
And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus
Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement._

To have the joy of the Lord, you must embrace and believe His
promises. If you don&rsquo;t really trust God, you won&rsquo;t
respond to the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s voice, telling you to have a
joyful attitude in the midst of difficulty. Joy! It&rsquo;s in His
promises!
