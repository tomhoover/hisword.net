_Isaiah 41:13  
For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee,
Fear not; I will help thee._

Are you left-handed or right-handed? It doesn't matter to God, He's
got you covered! He is holding on to you. You are secure with Him, and
He tells you not to fear! No matter what happens today, He is going to
be beside you and He will help you. That should make you kick up your
heels and shout, "Hallelujah!"
