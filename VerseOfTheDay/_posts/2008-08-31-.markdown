title: August 31st - God&rsquo;s Place of Faithfulness
---

_Matthew 25:21  
His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant:
thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over
many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord._

It&rsquo;s the end of another month of your life. Eternity is
closer today than it was yesterday. Invest your life, serving the
Lord while you can. Nothing will bring you more joy, than to one day
hear the Lord say, "You have been a faithful servant and done well!"
Be faithful!
