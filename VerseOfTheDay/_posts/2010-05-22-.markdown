title: May 22nd - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.
---

_Isaiah 1:16  
Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from
before mine eyes; cease to do evil._

Some people wash their clothes on Saturday, when they are off from
their regular jobs. Others wash their clothes on Monday, after a busy
weekend, to start the week off all clean. God reminds His people that
they need to wash EVERY DAY if they are to put evil out of their
lives. This not only means confessing your sin, but forsaking it as
well.
Extreme Love... thinketh no evil!
