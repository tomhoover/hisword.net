_II Corinthians 4:8-10  
We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed,
but not in despair; Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not
destroyed; Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord
Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our
body._

Do you need some "hope" today? Are you going through a hard time in
your life? There is hope because of Jesus Christ, IF you choose to see
it and embrace it! In fact, that is the way UP and out of
discouragement. Keep your eyes on JESUS, not your problems!
