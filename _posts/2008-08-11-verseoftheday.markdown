title: August 11th - God&rsquo;s Place of Faithfulness
---

_Psalm 89:1  
I will sing of the mercies of the LORD forever: with my mouth will I
make known thy faithfulness to all generations._

Do you sing? Do you hum? Is there joy in your heart today?
Don&rsquo;t let this be just an ordinary day! If you think about
God&rsquo;s mercy in your life, you must sing His praises with your
mouth! He&rsquo;s taken care of you! Now be sure and tell someone
younger than you today, that God has been faithful to you!
