_I Corinthians 4:2  
Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful._

You don't have to have lots of talent and abilities to find God's
favor in your life. You are required, however, to be faithful. How
are you faithful? In His Word, God demands that His children should
be faithful to His name. Speak it, share it, and respect it, in all
your daily conversations. God also asks His children to be faithful
to His church. Faithfully go to church when the doors are open for
worship. This is the way you outwardly show your FAITH in Him. Be
FAITHFUL while you can!
