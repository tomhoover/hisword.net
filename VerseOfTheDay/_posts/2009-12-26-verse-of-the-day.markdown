title: December 26th - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_Hebrews 13:5  
Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with
such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee,
nor forsake thee._

If someone should ask you what you received this Christmas, be sure
to tell them about your spiritual blessings before you rehearse your
material possessions. Our verse reminds us that one of our greatest
gifts is the promise of God's presence with us at all times. Are you
thankful for this promise? Contentment flows out of a thankful heart
for what you already possess!
