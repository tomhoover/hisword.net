title: July 20th - God&rsquo;s Place of Salvation
---

_Jude 3  
Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common
salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you,
that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once
delivered unto the saints._

You can&rsquo;t stop now! God is counting on YOU to make your life
count for Him! God has given you a job, and you must remain faithful
to His house, His work, and His people. Someone is going to need to
use your torch to light theirs. Therefore keep your light shining for
JESUS, and share the LIGHT of the gospel everywhere you go.
