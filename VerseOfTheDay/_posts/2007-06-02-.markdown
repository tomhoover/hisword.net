_Psalm 147:4  
He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their
names._

Read this verse with the previous verse, without a break. "He
healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. He telleth
the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names." From
the wounds of our hearts to the world of stars in the heavens there
is a great distance, yet our God cares about both. The God who
ordered the stars will order your life in His Son creating a
breathtaking portrait of beauty that only He can administer on the
tapestry of your life.
