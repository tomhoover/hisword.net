_Jeremiah 33:3  
Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty
things, which thou knowest not._

You may find yourself tired today. It is comforting to know that
our mighty God never tires, but is always faithful to hear your call.
Whenever your phone rings today, be reminded of your privilege to call
upon Him.
