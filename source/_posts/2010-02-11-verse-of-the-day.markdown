_Psalm 112:4  
Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is
gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous._

The LIGHT of God's grace is always shining; all we need to do is
take the cover off of the LIGHT! There are times when all we can
focus on is the darkness coming in around us. The LIGHT is present,
but we have covered it up with our indifference, apathy, and
self-absorption. Open your eyes and call upon your God, He's full of
grace and compassion. He wants to encourage you today, but you must
focus on God&rsquo;s LIGHT instead of the darkness.
