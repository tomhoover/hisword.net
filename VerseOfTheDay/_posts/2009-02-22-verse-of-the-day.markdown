_Colossians 3:13  
Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a
quarrel against any; even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye._

Why is it that we can remember the things we don't want to
remember, and forget the things we should remember? We should
remember that God has forgiven every one of our dirty, ugly sins. We
should forgive and forget the offenses of others, because we are
forgiven. You will enjoy church more, when your eyes are on the Lord,
not what others have done!
