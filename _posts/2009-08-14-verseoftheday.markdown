title: August 14th - Partnership with God for a Changed Life
---

_Psalm 121:8  
The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this
time forth and even for evermore._

It's great to know that no matter if you're going or coming, your
Partner, God, is with you. Before you get in your car today, stop and
ask Him to protect you from harm, and to guide your path. You can honk
if you love Jesus, just do it in your own driveway!
