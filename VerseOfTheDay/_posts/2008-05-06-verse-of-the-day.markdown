_Psalm 51:10  
Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within
me._

Do you need God to do something BIG in your life today? David was
asking the Creator to give him a new clean heart, realizing that sin
had corrupted his attitudes and actions. This is a BIG need in your
life also, as it restores the lifeline for victory.
