_I Corinthians 13:5d  
...thinketh no evil._

Experts in ancient Greek culture say that back in that day, people
didn&rsquo;t see their thoughts as belonging to them. They blamed the
gods and said they put the evil thoughts in their minds. They took no
responsibility for their own actions. It is not much different today,
but according to our verse, when you have extreme love,YOU will choose
to not think evil. You are accountable for what you think. It is a
personal choice! Ask God to help you "think right" today!
