_John 13:34  
A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I
have loved you, that ye also love one another._

It isn't that this is a new commandment, it's just that we all need
a "fresh vibrant love" for those in our sphere of influence. In the
midst of such a busy world, LOVE for others can be pushed out by
schedules and worldly pressures. Jesus reminds you today, as He did
His disciples, "showing a fresh vibrant LOVE to others" today, will
be the most important thing you do. Ask for God to renew your heart
and give you a "fresh love" for others.
