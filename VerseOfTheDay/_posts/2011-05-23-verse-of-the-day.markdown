_Jeremiah 20:12  
But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins
and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I
opened my cause._

There are times when people misunderstand you, and you are so glad
that God sees your heart and knows the truth of your good intentions.
The flip side of that is that God is also looking at your heart when
you say nice things, but you are secretly thinking bad things. The
heart is an open book for the Lord to read at all times! Be
challenged to think and act right today!
