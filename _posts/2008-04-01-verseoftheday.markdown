title: April 1st - God&rsquo;s Place of Care
---

_II Chronicles 16:9a  
For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth,
to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect
toward him._

There are cameras almost everywhere recording what you do.
God&rsquo;s been watching people for thousands of years, with a
desire to help them. God&rsquo;s cameras ARE EVERYWHERE! He cares
about you! There&rsquo;s no fooling God!
