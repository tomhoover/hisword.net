title: August 13th - Partnership with God for a Changed Life

_Psalm 31:7  
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy; for thou hast considered my
trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities._

If we aren't careful, we can wake up every morning thinking about
nothing but ourselves! Before you go any farther, stop and ask God to
help you think upon Him and others, before yourself today! It will
guarantee a great day!
