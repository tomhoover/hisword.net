_Ephesians 5:19  
Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord._

Our verse reminds you that when you sing in God's house, the words
of songs are important! They are supposed to speak to your heart. If
this is going to happen, you are going to have to use your mind and
apply each song to your own life. Worship won't happen for the
lazy-minded, but it's a treasure chest for the spiritual minded
person.
