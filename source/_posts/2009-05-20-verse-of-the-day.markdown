_Philippians 2:21  
For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's._

Few people are a part of the Lord's work, when ease, fame, and gain
have to be sacrificed. Most people help only when Christ's gain is
compatible with their own. This doesn't mean you aren't a Christian,
it just means, you have missed out on God's best for you today. Ask
God what He would have you do for Him today, and do it!
