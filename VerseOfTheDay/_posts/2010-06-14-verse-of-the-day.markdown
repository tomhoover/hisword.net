title: June 14th - Extreme Love...rejoices in truth.

_I John 2:4  
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a
liar, and the truth is not in him._

Do you ever lie to yourself? Everyone is guilty of that from time
to time. When the Holy Spirit talks to you about doing something, and
you put it off and never do it, you have not embraced the TRUTH. Ask
God to help you live and act in TRUTH today! Keep your word with God
and mankind. Always tell the truth! It's the best way!
