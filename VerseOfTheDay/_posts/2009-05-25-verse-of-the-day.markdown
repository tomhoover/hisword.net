_II Corinthians 12:10  
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ&rsquo;s sake:
for when I am weak, then am I strong._

Will you be honest? Do you really take pleasure in your problems?
Most of us wouldn't schedule problems in our lives, if we were in
charge. Your all knowing-God, however, understands your need for a
proper mind-set. He knows that when you are dependent upon Him, you
are at your best. It's only when you realize you are weak and call
upon Him that He can strengthen you. Can you take pleasure in your
problems, now? With a new mind-set, your problems become God's.
