_Revelation 2:10b  
...Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of
life._

Do you ever get tired of being the one who works at doing the right
thing all the time, and no one even seems to notice? You are
encouraged from God's Word today, to keep doing right until the day
you die. God does see your labors, and He will give you a crown, if
you remain faithful! WOW!! Yes, you can do it!!
