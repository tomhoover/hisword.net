_Luke 12:15  
And He said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a
man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he
possesseth._

The more possessions you have, the more worries you can have! Life
is too short, to be spent worrying about acquiring things that bring
only a short season of pleasure. Why not simplify your life, and
decide you just need less?
