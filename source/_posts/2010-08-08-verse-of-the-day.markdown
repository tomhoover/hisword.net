_Zechariah 9:12  
Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I
declare that I will render double unto thee._

It has been said, "Many of the great achievements of this world
were accomplished by tired and discouraged men who just kept on
working." These people could be called "prisoners of hope." They are
the people who don't give up when things get hard. Are you that type
of person? The Lord ends our verse with a double blessing for those
who faithfully live their lives in HOPE.
