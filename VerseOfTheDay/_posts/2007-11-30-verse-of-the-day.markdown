title: November 30th - God's Place of Healing
---

_John 12:40  
He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they
should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and
be converted, and I should heal them._

There are many ways for God to get your attention. Don't be blind
or close your heart to God, as He longs to draw you closer to Himself
and make your life one of blessing.
