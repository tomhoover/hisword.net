title: March 2nd - Extreme Love...is giving.
---

_Luke 6:30  
Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away
thy goods ask them not again._

This is EXTREME!! You are admonished to have a loving heart that
gives to others, without expecting to get reimbursed. In other words,
you might actually have to do without something for yourself in order
to be able to give a "free gift" to someone else. That's why the best
"free" gifts a Christian can give, are those given anonymously. There
are no "strings" attached to those gifts. Instead of making you look
good, they make God look good. Ask God to lay someone on your heart
today that He wants to encourage!
