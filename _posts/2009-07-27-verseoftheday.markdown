title: July 27th - Partnership with God in Sacrifice

_Acts 5:41-42  
41 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.  
42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to
teach and preach Jesus Christ._

Christians, during the time of Christ, were subject to much more
persecution than you presently face. Yet, they rejoiced to be able to
suffer for Christ, and daily told others about Him! Could this be why
Christians have less joy today?
