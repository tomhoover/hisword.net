_John 10:11  
I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the
sheep._

"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life
for his friends." These are the words of Jesus to His disciples.
Jesus is our example, we are to lay down our lives for our brethren
and for the lost who will become a sheep. The irony of this is that
laying down our lives as a living sacrifice for Christ actually
involves living for Him, not dying for Him. He died that we might
live.
