_Psalm 145:9  
The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his
works. _

"God's pity is not as some sweet cordial, poured in dainty drops
from a golden phial. It is not like the musical water-drops of some
slender rill, murmuring down the dark side of Mount Sinai. It is wide
as the whole scope of heaven. It is abundant as all the air." "He has
constantly revealed himself to them in various ways; constantly shed
innumerable benefits on them; sometimes lovingly correcting, and
sometimes bountifully blessing them; has constantly been nigh to
them, and has left them in want of no means for becoming wiser and
better." Treasury of Knowledge & George Joachim Zollikofer
