_Luke 12:15  
And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a
man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he
possesseth._

Many people recite the quote, "You can't take it with you," and yet
they live their life in a "grab all you can get" fervor. Their actions
contradict their words. Ask the Lord to help you make good decisions,
especially at this time of the year. May you be more mindful of the
needs of others, and content with the things you have.
