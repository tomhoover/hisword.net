_Hebrews 11:20  
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come._

Nobody can accurately tell you your future, but through the Bible
you can not only see the future, you can invest in it. It's called
FAITH LINE - passing your FAITH down from one generation to another.
You actually bless your children when you share your beliefs in God,
and share your belief in them as a person. Blessing people in your
life is a Biblical concept! FAITH-LINE - connecting your FAITH with
others.
