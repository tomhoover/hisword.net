_Psalm 98:1  
O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things:
his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory._

&ldquo;Victory in Jesus&rdquo; is a song that Christian people have
sung for years. It&rsquo;s good to sing the old songs, but God loves
to see &ldquo;fresh faith&rdquo;, also. &ldquo;Fresh faith&rdquo;
happens when a truth from God&rsquo;s Word becomes so real and
exciting, that it bubbles out in praise and song to God. Have you
ever written a song or a verse of praise to God? He&rsquo;s leaning
over heaven&rsquo;s edge to hear you.
