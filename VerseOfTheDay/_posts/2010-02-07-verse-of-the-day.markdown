_Hebrews 12:28  
Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have
grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly
fear._

You aren't alone in your struggle to be more loving and gracious to
others. If you have given your heart to Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit
has come to reside within your heart, and He will prompt you to do
and say the right things. The question for the believer is, "Will you
listen and respond accordingly?" The answer to that question is most
often based upon your present relationship with God.
