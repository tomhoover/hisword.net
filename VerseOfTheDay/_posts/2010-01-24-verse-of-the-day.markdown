title: January 24th - Extreme Love...Is not proud or self-focused
---

_Ecclesiastes 12:14  
Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep
his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man._

What really matters in life is not how long you live, but how well
you live. Some people live for 85 years and do very little. Others
live only a relatively few years, but they fill that time with
service to God and others, and it will be their influence that lives
on, after they are gone. The bottom line: "Love God and love others,"
and you will have had a successful life!
