_Psalm 103:11  
For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy
toward them that fear him._

Are you down and discouraged today? Let this verse lift your
spirits! God's mercy, which describes His kindness and His commitment
to treating you better than you deserve, is measureless. It reaches
higher than the heavens! This means that there is not one situation,
not one problem, that is beyond His ability and desire to help you!
