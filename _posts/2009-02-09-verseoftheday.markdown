title: February 9th - Partnership with God in Loving Relationships
---

_Luke 6:35  
But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing
again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children
of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil._

Your Partner, God, is loving, kind, and good to everyone, even the
unthankful and those who are bad to the bone. Sometime today, your
love for the unlovely, will be tested. Be ready! If you have the
proper response and motive, your reward will be great!
