_Romans 13:1  
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no
power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God._

God appoints every nation's leaders, but they are not all appointed
to bless every nation. Sometimes God allows leaders to set the stage
for His judgment to be executed. Since governments have authority
from God, we are to obey them unless they go directly against God's
commandments. It doesn't matter what you think about your current
president, you should pray for him. This is all a part of God's
glorious plan to bring about the end times. Until then...TRUST GOD!
Give respect to those due, realizing GOD has everything under
control, and He has all POWER!
FAITH LIFT: Keeping your eyes on Him not others!
