_John 15:13  
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for
his friends._

Happy "LOVE" Day! This is a day set aside to show love to those in
our lives who are special to us. What about those who aren't so easy
to love? Would this be a good day to reach out to them in love? "We
come to love not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see
an imperfect person perfectly in need of love right where they are."
&ndash; Anonymous. Do you love the unlovely?
