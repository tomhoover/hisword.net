_Psalm 34:19  
Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth
him out of them all._

The false, greedy, and fame-seeking media evangelists who preach a
gospel of wealth and well-being in place of the Gospel of Jesus
Christ in repentance and faith, would rather that this verse say
"Absent are the afflictions of the righteous", instead of "Many." If
you are a believer who is determined to serve Jesus Christ, expect
opposition, especially from the unseen world, but remember, GREAT IS
YOUR REWARD IN HEAVEN! Not only will it be great, it will be eternal,
and you can see it by faith in God's promises!
