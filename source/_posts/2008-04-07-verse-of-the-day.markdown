_Jeremiah 1:5  
Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou
camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a
prophet unto the nations._

God has a plan for your life today. Before you go any further into
the day, stop and ask Him to give you His eyes and ears to see the
world and lives of others that you could impact for His glory.
