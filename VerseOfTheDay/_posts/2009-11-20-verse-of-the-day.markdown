_II Peter 2:9  
The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to
reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished._

God, because He is EXTREMELY loving and kind, wants to help you
make the right choices in your life every day. If you are a
Christian, when you pray to Him, He will give you the strength to
overcome temptation. The choice to call upon Him, is left up to you.
After death, you will face one of two EXTREMES, heaven or hell,
according to your choice of Jesus Christ as your Savior. Will you
make good choices today? Ask for God's help!
