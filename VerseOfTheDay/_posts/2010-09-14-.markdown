title: September 14th - Extreme Love...endures through trials.
---

_I Corinthians 1:5a  
That in everything you are enriched by Him..._

Not everything!! Yes, everything!! Does that mean that we are made
better in Christ because of trials? That pretty much is included in
everything. Instead of looking at the problems in your life as
overwhelming, reverse your thought pattern and try to imagine how God
is going to get the victory. That will bring HOPE back into your life!
SMILE, it can brighten the darkest day!
