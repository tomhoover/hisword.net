_Luke 23:34  
Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots._

Someone said, "There is no love without forgiveness, and there is
no forgiveness without love." That is an especially true statement in
the life of our Savior Jesus Christ. His Extreme Love forgave the
soldiers who were mocking and belittling Him. Will you have the same
kind of LOVE today? Will you forgive someone who has hurt you?
