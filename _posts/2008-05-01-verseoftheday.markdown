title: May 1st - God&rsquo;s Place of Victory
---

_Deuteronomy 20:3-4  
3 And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto
battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and
do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;  
4 For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you
against your enemies, to save you._

Prepare your heart as you begin this day, by asking God to do what
you cannot do. The Christian life is a spiritual battle that begins
in the mind. The adversary will use intimidation and fear in an
effort to overcome you, but if you&rsquo;ve called upon God, He will
save you.
