_I Peter 5:10  
But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory
by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you
perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you._

Someone said, "Great achievement is usually born out of great
sacrifice, and is never the result of selfishness." This was true in
the life of Jesus Christ. What about your life? Are you will to make
a selfless sacrifice for Him today?
