title: August 16th - God&rsquo;s Place of Faithfulness
---

_Proverbs 25:13  
As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his
masters._

It&rsquo;s August and it&rsquo;s hot outside! Can you imagine how
good a snowstorm would feel today? Wouldn&rsquo;t the cool weather be
an encouraging change? There are people in your life who could use an
encouraging word today. You never know who it is, so it would be good
to just try to encourage everyone who crosses your path today.
