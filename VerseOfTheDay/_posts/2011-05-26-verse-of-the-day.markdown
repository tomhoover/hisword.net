_Psalm 11:7  
For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth
behold the upright._

Don't you wish you could always do the right thing at the right
time? Take comfort in the thought that the Lord looks at your heart,
and knows when you are desiring to please Him. May your prayer and
focus be to please the LORD today!
