_Song of Solomon 2:4  
He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was
love._

In our verse we are given a picture of what God's EXTREME love
looks like. A bridegroom prepares only the best table for his bride.
God gave His best, Jesus Christ, wrapped Him in love, and gave Him to
all who accept Him as their Savior. As you go throughout the day,
before each of your meals, take the time to thank God for lovingly
giving His best.
