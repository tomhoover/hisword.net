_Psalm 17:7  
Show thy marvelous lovingkindness, O Thou that savest by Thy right
hand them which put their trust in Thee from those that rise up
against them._

Be filled with hope and encouragement today, no matter what faces
you. The God of creation, and author of your salvation, has you by
the right hand. He will lead you safely through all things, and when
you cannot stand, He will bear you in His arms. Either he will shield
you from suffering, or He will give you unfailing strength to bear it,
if you have FAITH!
