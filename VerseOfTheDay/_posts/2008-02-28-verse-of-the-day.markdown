_Proverbs 27:6  
Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are
deceitful._

What does this verse seem to be saying to you today? Do you need to
be more patient with friends? Patience and understanding are lost
virtues in this world. If you have these virtues in your life, people
are sure to see God!
