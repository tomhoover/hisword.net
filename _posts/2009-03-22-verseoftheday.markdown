title: March 22nd - Partnership with God to Touch Lives

_Romans 6:23  
For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life
through Jesus Christ our Lord._

Is it more fun to receive a gift or be the giver of a gift? Most of
us like to give gifts, especially if they don't cost too much. The
greatest gift ever given cost God the greatest price. Don't be
stingy! God wants you to be a generous and giving person. Share God's
plan of salvation with someone today!
