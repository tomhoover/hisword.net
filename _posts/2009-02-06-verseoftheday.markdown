title: February 6th - Partnership with God in Loving Relationships
---

_I John 4:7  
Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one
that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God._

God's love is not like any other love talked about in this world.
God's love is so powerful, that it can literally transform you to
want to love those who you at first thought you could not love. Take
a moment to pray for the people who God brings to mind, and thank God
for His unconditional love in your life.
