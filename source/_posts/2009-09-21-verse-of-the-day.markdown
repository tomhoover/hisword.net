_Matthew 16:18b  
Upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall
not prevail against it._

For over 2,000 years people have tried to discredit Jesus and His
churches. Yet, His churches still exist and are flourishing to this
present day, as a testimony to the promise He made in our verse. Have
you ever stopped to realize the significance of this? This privilege
has been granted to you through the blood, sweat, and tears of many
Christians through the years. Jesus gets the glory, and you get the
benefits! Praise His name!
