_I Timothy 5:8  
But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his
own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel._

The greatest gift you can give your family is the testimony of
knowing Jesus as your personal Savior. Today, think of some way to
tell or show your family just how important Jesus is to your life.
