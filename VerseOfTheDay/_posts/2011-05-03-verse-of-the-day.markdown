_Psalm 62:7  
In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my
refuge, is in God._

Rocks are solid and sure. This is the picture that the psalmist
wants to impress upon your mind. There is nothing in this present
world's system that qualifies as being solid and sure. Whatever your
circumstance in life today, God is still the refuge, solid and sure
for every believer. Do you have FAITH in God?
