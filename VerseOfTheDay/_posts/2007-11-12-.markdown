title: November 12th - God's Place of Healing
---

_Isaiah 53:5  
But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his
stripes we are healed._

Our healing came at a great price for Jesus Christ. Be willing to
make any sacrifice you can for Him today.
