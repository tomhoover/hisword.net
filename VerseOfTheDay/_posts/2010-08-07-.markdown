title: August 7th - Extreme Love...hopes and believes the best.
---

_Hebrews 11:1  
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen._

In order for some people to believe in some things, they must make
sense or logic of it. That's pretty much a dead end street when it
comes to explaining God's EXTREME LOVE for mankind. It's totally
beyond our reasoning and logic that God's love would send His Son to
die for our sins. But that is God's great qualifier...believing in
what you cannot see, or logically explain. This defines faith, a life
that evidences a purposed HOPE in the unseen God. Do you believe? Walk
in faith today, and act like it!
