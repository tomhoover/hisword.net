_Jeremiah 31:3  
The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved
thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I
drawn thee._

God&rsquo;s love, so universal and yet personal, has existed
through all eternity. On this day, this same God of eternity, singles
you out to express His love and desire to be close to you! Do you feel
close to Him?
