_Psalm 25:11  
For thy name sake, O LORD, pardon my iniquity; for it is great._

How was church yesterday? Did God speak to you through His Word and
His leader? Sometimes it's hard for us to see our sin, and God will
use His Word and His messenger to reveal our great need of repentance
and forgiveness. Thank God for lovingly changing you into His image.
