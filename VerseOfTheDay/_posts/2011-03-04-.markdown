_Hebrews 11:5  
By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was
not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation
he had this testimony, that he pleased God._

Is your life pleasing to God? How do you know if it is? The answer
is in one word, FAITH! We are told that it is totally impossible to
please God without FAITH! In the case of Enoch, his FAITH was so
pleasing to God, that he did not even see death. God still rewards
FAITH when He sees it in the lives of His children! The question must
be asked again. "Are you living to please yourself or God?"
