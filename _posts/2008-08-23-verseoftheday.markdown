title: August 23rd - God&rsquo;s Place of Faithfulness
---

_Psalm 143:1  
Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy
faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness._

God is faithful to hear His children&rsquo;s prayers. He never gets
tired of you asking for His help and direction. He answers all your
prayers, knowing what&rsquo;s best for you. You can trust Him! Have
you thanked Him today?
