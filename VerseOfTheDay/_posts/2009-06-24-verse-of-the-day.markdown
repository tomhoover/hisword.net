title: June 24th - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith
---

_Job 13:15a  
Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him._

FAITH isn't just believing in things you can't see, it's trusting
God to protect you from the things that you can see. It's giving God
the permission to do whatever He wants with your life, and embracing
His choice. It's being willing to risk your life for Him. Step out
and take the FAITH challenge today.
