_Revelation 21:5  
And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new.
And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful._

Are you tired of the same old routine every day? Are you bored with
your life? Instead of going out and spending money you don&rsquo;t
have to buy new things, ask God to give you a &ldquo;new&rdquo;
attitude! When you change your attitude, it changes your world!
