_Psalm 91:15-16  
15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him
in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.  
16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation._

Here we have the Lord, Himself, speaking of His own Son. As a man
and our sacrifice He will have need to pray, and the answer shall
surely come. Christians are first called of God, and then they call
upon God and such calls always obtain answers. Not without prayer
will the blessings come to His people. By means of prayer they shall
receive all good things.
