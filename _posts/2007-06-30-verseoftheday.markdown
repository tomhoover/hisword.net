_Hebrews 4:16  
Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may
obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need._

The Jewish Christians to whom the writer of Hebrews writes would
well understand the power of this verse. In the Jewish sacrificial
system, the people went through the priests, through blood sacrifices
to come before God. In Christ, the ultimate sacrificial Lamb and Great
High Priest, we have direct access to God&rsquo;s throne where we find
an abundant supply of mercy and grace.
