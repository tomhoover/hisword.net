title: November 16th - Partnership with God in Prayer
---

_Psalm 62:8  
Trust in Him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before
Him: God is a refuge for us._

Everyone has something that they feel that they could just not tell
anyone for fear of their rejection or critical judgment. This is not
true when it comes to God. You can pour your heart out to Him and
share every thought and secret with Him. It will make you feel
better, and it puts your Partner in a place where He can help you.
