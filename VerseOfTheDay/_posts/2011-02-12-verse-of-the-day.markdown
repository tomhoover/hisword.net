title: February 12th - FaithForce...engaging your faith in Spiritual
---

_II Timothy 3:14  
But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast
been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them._

You shouldn't believe everything you hear. On the other hand, you
can have great FAITH in God's Words to you. If He says He will take
care of you and provide for you, then He will. If He says He will
repay those who do evil, then He will. If He says He will never leave
you alone, then He will never leave you alone. Continue believing in
God's Words, as He has proven to have a perfect track record!! It's
called Faith FORCE!
