_I Peter 2:5  
Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy
priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by
Jesus Christ._

Our verse reminds us that our bodies are the temple of God, a
spiritual house, where He abides after salvation. We are just given a
short time upon this earth to give Him our best. Make your life count
for God today!
