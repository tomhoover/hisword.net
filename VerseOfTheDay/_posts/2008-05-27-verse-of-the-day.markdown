_Psalm 95:1  
O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the
rock of our salvation. _

Do you sing when you are by yourself? If you are happy and thankful
for what God has done for you, your joy can come out as a song on any
day of the week. When you sing on Sunday, it&rsquo;s more often for
the ears of others than God. If you sing a song to God on Tuesday,
God will know you meant it for His ears only! SING! God&rsquo;s
listening.
