_Psalm 40:4  
Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth
not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies._

Pride is the enemy of God and the Christian life. Pride causes
mankind to put their HOPE in themselves over God. We all like to
think we can handle things by ourselves from time to time, but the
truth is, we need to put our trust in God for every situation, big or
small. Pride will be the Christian's constant lifetime enemy. There
will never be a day upon this earth that you will not have to push
aside "self-reliance" and replace it with "submission" to your LORD.
Begin your day with a trusting, submissive heart.
