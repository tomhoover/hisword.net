title: January 4th - God's Place of Power
---

_Psalm 106:48  
Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting:
and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD._

It&rsquo;s a brand new year. What is God doing "new" in your life?
Although, God never changes, there should be new praise for the new
beginnings God gives us everyday.
