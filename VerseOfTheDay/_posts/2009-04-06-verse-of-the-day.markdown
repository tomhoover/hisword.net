title: April 6th - Partnership with God for a Victorious Life
---

_Psalm 23:1  
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want._

God is the Shepherd for the world at large, but He is also each
believer's personal Shepherd caring for their every need. When you
grasp God's passionate "one on one" love for you, your desires for
worldly things, will fade. In it's place you will value, love,
forgiveness, grace, and peace, the things money can&rsquo;t buy. Take
time to thank your Shepherd for the victorious blessings of His
wonderful provisions.
