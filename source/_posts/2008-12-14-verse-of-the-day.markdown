_Psalm 145:16  
Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living
thing._

Do you ever have trouble knowing what gift to get someone? The
Creator, who made you, knows exactly what each one of His creations
need. Imagine God opening His hand, and flinging love, joy, and
encouragement upon YOU, today! He absolutely gives the best gifts.
Take time to thank Him.
