title: July 17th - God&rsquo;s Place of Salvation
---

_Isaiah 43:11  
I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no Savior._

Hello! Take a quick trip in your mind. If you would be able to come
visibly into God&rsquo;s presence and His holiness today, you would
see that Jesus is the Savior of the world and there is NONE other!
Since you can&rsquo;t go there bodily, you are left with believing in
something you cannot see. This is called the &ldquo;eye of
faith.&rdquo; Without faith it is impossible to please God. Everyone
must decide at some point along life&rsquo;s journey to accept or to
reject Jesus Christ. Your decision determines your destiny and JOY
for the journey!
