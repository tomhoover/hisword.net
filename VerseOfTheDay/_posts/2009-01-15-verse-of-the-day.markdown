_Nehemiah 8:10b  
For the joy of the Lord is your strength._

Have you had your legs knocked out from under you lately? It is
God's joy to stand you back upon your wobbly legs. God wants you to
know that it is His joy to become the strength in your life that will
secure your uncertain days. If you need strength today, call upon
Him.
