_Philippians 4:6  
Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto
God._

Can you thank God for the suffering and afflictions in your life?
It will bring you into a closer relationship with God. Prepare your
own heart. Prayer and a thankful heart will bring your Thanksgiving
Day!
