_Psalm 51:11  
Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit
from me._

What are some things you can't live without? Coffee? Bread?
Chocolate? As Christians we absolutely need God's presence in our
lives; because, without His Holy Spirit to guide and direct us we can
go astray. Stop and tell God that you NEED HIM TODAY!
