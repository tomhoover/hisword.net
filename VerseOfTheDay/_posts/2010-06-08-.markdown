title: June 8th - Extreme Love...rejoices in truth.
---

_John 3:21  
But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be
made manifest, that they are wrought in God._

A lot of things in this world don't make sense when you look at
them from an earthly perspective. It is only when we consider the
supernatural work of God in this world that things make real sense.
Darkness holds no power over you when you hold on to the light of His
TRUTH. How can you keep from rejoicing when you understand this
TRUTH?
