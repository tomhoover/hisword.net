_Romans 8:28  
And we know that all things work together for good to them that love
God, to them who are the called according to his purpose._

God is able to work ALL things, not some, for good to those who
love Him. When you LOVE God in the truest sense, you look for the
good that comes out of every situation or trial in your life. Take a
moment to praise God for the "good" in your life. Name it and claim
it for God.
