_Ephesians 4:7  
But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of
the gift of Christ._

All the gifts that God has given to us are given for us to share
with others. You haven't been given love, forgiveness, or patience,
to use just for your own good. These gifts are given to you in grace,
and you are to show the same grace to others by giving love,
forgiveness and patience to them. Share God's gifts in your world
today!
