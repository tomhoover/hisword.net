_I John 4:16  
And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is
love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him._

It's Monday, and you might be having a struggle to just get going
today. There is nothing more powerful in this world than God's love.
If you have asked Jesus into your heart, that same love is within
you. Realize what you have and walk confidently in God&rsquo;s love
today! Let "love" be seen in you today!
