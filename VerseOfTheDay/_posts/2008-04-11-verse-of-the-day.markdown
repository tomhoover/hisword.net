title: April 11th- God&rsquo;s Place of Care
---

_Psalm 17:6  
I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine
ear unto me, and hear my speech._

You can be confident that if you call upon God, He will hear you.
Not only does God hear your prayers, He leans forward to see your
face and catch your tears. God cares about you.
