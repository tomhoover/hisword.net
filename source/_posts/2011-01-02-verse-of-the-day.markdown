_Psalm 119:105  
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path._

Your Bible, the WORD of God, is one of your greatest possessions!
It tells you where you are going, how to get there, and how to live
your life until you get there! WOW! This is a necessary element for
the Christian life! You must take time to connect with God through
His WORD every day of your life. It keeps your feet on the right
path! Do it!
