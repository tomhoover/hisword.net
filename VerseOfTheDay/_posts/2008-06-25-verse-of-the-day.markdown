title: June 25th - God&rsquo;s Place of Peace
---

_Psalm 85:10  
Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
kissed each other._

As you go through your day, in each and every situation and
decision, follow God&rsquo;s criteria. What is truth? What does the
Bible say about it? Is my decision balanced with mercy? When you
incorporate &ldquo;mercy and truth&rdquo; into your life, you will
find that righteousness and peace are the sweet loving result. Your
life will be kissed with righteousness and peace. Did you feel
God&rsquo;s kiss?
