_Ephesians 3:19  
And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye
might be filled with all the fulness of God._

If we could fully understand God's love, our lives would radically
be changed. The best narrative of God's love leaves us searching for
words that have not been spoken this side of heaven. God's love fills
the whole earth penetrating everything it touches, yet we walk in the
midst of it unmoved. Oh to be filled with an awareness of this GREAT
love and His presence in our lives! Look for God's love in your world
today! It's beyond words, but it's not beyond you! It's all around
you.....do you see it?
