_I Corinthians 12:25  
That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members
should have the same care one for another._

It happens everywhere! There are problems in every organization on
earth, because there are no perfect human beings! The Christian is
called to work out their problems with others, to bring unity to the
body. The world always wants to blame someone else and find fault.
Christians following Christ's example, will humble themselves, and do
what is necessary to make it right. Do you need to lay aside a petty
issue for the body's sake?
