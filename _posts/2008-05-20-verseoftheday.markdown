title: May 20th - God&rsquo;s Place of Victory
---

_I John 5:4  
For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the
victory that overcometh the world, even our faith._

Watch out! You can feel like you&rsquo;re drowning in this world if
you listen to the wrong voices. The victory over these fears comes
when we, in FAITH, shut our ears to those loud voices, and cling to
God. Pray for FAITH to win the victory over your struggles today.
