_I Peter 1:7  
That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold
that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto
praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ._

If just getting through trials wasn't enough, according to our
verse, you are measured by them! That's a sobering thought! But the
other part of that verse says that they can be precious, because you
can lay the rewards of endurance at the feet of Jesus! What do you
think? Can you do it? Will you, in FAITH, endure to the end? You are
not alone. He promises to be with you, all the way!
