_Philippians 3:14  
I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
Christ Jesus._

It has been said, /"He who aims at nothing, almost always hits
it!"/ If you aren't challenged to make some changes in your life, you
are going backwards. The Christian life is all about becoming more
like Jesus Christ. It's not too late to set some Christian goals for
your life. Don't waste your life, go for the prize!
