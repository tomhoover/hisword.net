title: October 18th - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_I Timothy 6:11  
But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after
righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness._

One of the requirements in the Bible for leaders is that they be
patient. Since we are all leaders in one or more areas of our lives,
that means everyone needs to have patience. When things don't go as
you would like them to sometime during this day, be reminded that
patience pleases God. You don't have to pray for trials to grow more
patience, but you do need to pray for strength to be more patient!
