_Isaiah 9:6-7  
6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called
Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The
Prince of Peace.  
7 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end,
upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to
establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for
ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this._

It&rsquo;s the birthday of the King! "Unto us a child is born,"
shows Jesus, in human form, connecting Himself to you. "Unto us a son
is given," shows Jesus in heavenly form connecting you to God, through
forgiveness of sin. The MIGHTY GOD, well, that says it all! Praise
Him!
