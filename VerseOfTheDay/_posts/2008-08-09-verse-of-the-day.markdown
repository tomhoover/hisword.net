title: August 9th - God&rsquo;s Place of Faithfulness
---

_Job 1:21  
And said, Naked came I out of my mother&rsquo;s womb, and naked
shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away,
blessed be the name of the LORD._

Everything in this life, that you call yours, is truly a gift from
God and really belongs to Him. There is a time that He gives you
things, and there is a time that He takes things away. The challenge
for the day is to be able to tell God that you trust Him and bless
His name, for all He gives AND takes away. It&rsquo;s all His,
anyway. Blessed be the name of the LORD!
