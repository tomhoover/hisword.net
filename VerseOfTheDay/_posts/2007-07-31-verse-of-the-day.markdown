_Ephesians 5:14  
Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the
dead, and Christ shall give thee light._

The Greek word here for "give thee light" (epiphinei) means to
shine brightly. This word is used in the New Testament to describe
the brilliant light associated with Christ&rsquo;s second coming, and
that may well be the message here. Jesus' face shined when He was
transfigured before three apostles and, get this; II Thessalonians
2:8 tells us that when Jesus returns, He will destroy the antichrist
with the "brightness (epiphinei) of His coming." Hallelujah!
