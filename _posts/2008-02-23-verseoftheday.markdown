title: February 23rd - God's Place of Presence
---

_Psalm 100:2  
Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with
singing._

Tomorrow is Sunday. Prepare your heart today, for tomorrow. Ask God
to give you a spirit of gladness as you go to His place of worship.
When you sing, purpose to sing unto Him.
