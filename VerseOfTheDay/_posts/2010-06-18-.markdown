title: June 18th - Extreme Love...rejoices in truth.
---

_Ephesians 6:14  
Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having
on the breastplate of righteousness._

In our verse we come to understand that TRUTH is a weapon in the
life of a believer. It is to cover the heart of the believer and to
keep them protected from the lies of the enemy. The problem is you
must know the TRUTH before you can use it as your weapon. You are in
a battle for your life, and you must put on God's armor of TRUTH
before you face the giants in your life! The Lord wants to help you
fight your battles! Wear His TRUTH today!
