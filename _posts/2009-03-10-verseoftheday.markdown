title: March 10th - Partnership with God to Touch Lives
---

_II Peter 3:9  
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any
should perish, but that all should come to repentance._

According to our verse, God is patiently waiting on sinners to give
their heart to Him. However, He has also promised that there will be a
day when it is too late. The most important thing to remember is that
God keeps His promises! We must have faith like Noah, and tell
everyone we know about Jesus, before the door closes.
