title: September 24th - Extreme Love...endures through trials.

_Proverbs 11:8  
The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in
his stead._

What does this verse have to do with Mordecai, Daniel, and Peter in
prison? They all were delivered out of trouble, but there's more. They
all were righteous men who feared and loved the Almighty God! God has
an ear for His children in trouble, in spite of all the loud noise
and distractions in this troubled world. Just in case you think God
isn't hearing you, be corrected, He heard you yesterday, hears you
today, and will hear you tomorrow! Smile, you're covered with His
LOVE!
