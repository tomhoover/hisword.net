_Jeremiah 33:3  
Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and
mighty things, which thou knowest not._

"In whom (Christ) are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
knowledge" (Col. 2:3). To understand and revel in the knowledge of
God, you MUST come to Christ for it can be revealed no where else!
The knowledge of God in all its truth is taught in a Scripturally
sound church, which Paul said is a "body of Christ" and a "pillar and
ground of the truth." We don't need new revelation from God, for if we
had a million lifetimes to fully understand the knowledge of God, we
would still be ignorant!
