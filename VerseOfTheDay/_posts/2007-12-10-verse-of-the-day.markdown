_Philippians 2:5-7  
5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:  
6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal
with God:  
7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
servant, and was made in the likeness of men._

There are fifteen days till Christmas. This is a good time to
prepare your mind to focus on Christ, not material things. Christ was
our example by keeping the proper focus and not worrying about what
others thought.
