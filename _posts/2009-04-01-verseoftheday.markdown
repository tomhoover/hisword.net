title: April 1st - Partnership with God for a Victorious Life
---

_Ecclesiastes 7:9  
Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the
bosom of fools._

Today is the day set aside for "foolish pranks," or April Fool's
Day. The real "fool" is the person who gets angry or upset and won't
let go of offenses. The "fool" thinks he is getting his own revenge,
when he withholds kind words and actions. When you ask for your
Partner's help, He will help you get the victory over anger and
revenge. God can give you the power to respond in the right way to
offenses.
