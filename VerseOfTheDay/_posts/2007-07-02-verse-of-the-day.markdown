_Psalm 97:11  
Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in
heart._

When a seed is sown or planted, you do not immediately see the
fruit, yet, by faith, you see it. Jesus is the Light of the World and
the Light of our lives. God&rsquo;s light has been planted, and we see
it by faith now for, eye hath not seen nor has ear heard the light of
His glory that will be revealed to us hereafter. Let this also be a
motivator for us to share the Gospel for neither has the unbeliever
ever seen the darkness that awaits the rejecter of Christ.
