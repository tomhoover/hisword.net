_Mark 16:5-6  
And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the
right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were afraid. And
he saith unto them, Be not afraid: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which
was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where
they laid him._

It's Easter, and this is going to be one of those busy days when
the purpose of the day can be covered up with activity. Take a moment
and thank JESUS for the great sacrifice He made on the cross for your
sins! The message of the empty tomb is still as POWERFUL today, as it
was then! JESUS IS ALIVE! Live like it!
