_Exodus 16:8b  
...your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord._

Sometimes we forget that God hears all the things that we complain
about throughout the day. Indirectly most of our complaints fall at
God's feet. Try not to complain about anything today! It will be
work, but it will be rewarding.
