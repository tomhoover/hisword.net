_Psalm 27:1  
The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD
is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?_

Fear is one of the main weapons of the enemy, and it works more
times than you might imagine. It is especially effective when we are
walking in darkness. How do you know if the LIGHT is turned on? When
the LIGHT is turned on, your focus is on the LORD and not the
darkness (fear) around you. Maybe you need to get up and turn the
LIGHT on! The LORD is my LIGHT! Is HE?
