_Romans 15:5  
Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded
one toward another according to Christ Jesus:_

God uses the Scriptures to both describe and reveal Himself to us.
Here He first reveals that to all of mankind He is a God of patience,
He is endurant and long-suffering with believers and unbelievers.
Second, He reveals that He is a God of consolation, He gives comfort
and solace to all who seek for it. Another way to think about God in
this verse is that He is both the God of hope and the God of peace,
without whom we could have neither.
