_Titus 2:13-14  
Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the
great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; Who gave himself for us, that
he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a
peculiar people, zealous of good works._

Are you tired of sin capturing and ruining the lives of people you
know? Are you weary of sin's power in your own life? Are you looking
for some HOPE in this life? It's found in Jesus Christ! He died to
forgive your sins, and to help you be an overcomer as a Chirstian.
HOPE doesn't end here, He's coming back to this earth one day soon.
HOPE is realized in eternity. Be encouraged!
