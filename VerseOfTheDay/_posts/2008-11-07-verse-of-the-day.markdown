_Psalm 138:3  
In the day when I cried Thou answerest me, and strengthenest me with
strength in my soul._

It's almost the end of the week. Physically, you are probably tired
and in need of some strength. We are told that when we call upon God,
He will answer and strengthen us. Have you ever experienced the
prayers of someone else praying for you, and you felt stronger? Would
you take just a minute to pray for someone else in your life this
morning that might be weary?
