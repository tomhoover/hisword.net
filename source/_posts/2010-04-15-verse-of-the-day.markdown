_James 1:19  
Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow
to speak, slow to wrath._

Much can be said of a person's character by the way they use their
tongue. It was Teddy Roosevelt who said, "Speak softly and carry a
big stick." But the truth is, if you speak softly you won't need a
big stick! The Bible tells us to use words which cannot be condemned.
Every Christian's prayer should be, "Lord, make my words gracious and
tender, for tomorrow I may have to eat them."
