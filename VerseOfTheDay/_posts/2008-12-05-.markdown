_Acts 20:35  
I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring you ought to
support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he
said, It is more blessed to give than to receive._

There is someone in your life who needs encouragement today, and
you are the one to give it. Encouragement is a gift that won't cost
you any money, but it has great rewards. Ask God to help you be an
encourager!
