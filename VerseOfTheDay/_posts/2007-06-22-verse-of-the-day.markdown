_Psalm 48:14  
For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide
even unto death._

This is the awesome part of becoming a Christian. The God of the
universe becomes your God forever! Not only that, but He becomes your
Father, and intimately loves you as He tells the Apostle Paul to tell
us to call Him &ldquo;Abba (papa) Father.&rdquo; He will never leave
us nor forsake us in life, and especially in death, which is actually
the mysterious passageway into eternal life in Christ for the
believer.
