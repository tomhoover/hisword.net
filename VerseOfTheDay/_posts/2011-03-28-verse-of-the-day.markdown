_Deuteronomy 7:9  
Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God,
which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his
commandments to a thousand generations._

Imagine the thousands of generations that have preceded you upon
this earth. Your blood line goes all the way back to Adam. FAITH Line
also goes back to Adam. God covered him with the shed blood of an
animal and Adam accepted God's gift. What a FAITH FULL and merciful
God we know, Who loves and not only keeps His promises to us today,
but to the thousands of generations that have gone before us!
