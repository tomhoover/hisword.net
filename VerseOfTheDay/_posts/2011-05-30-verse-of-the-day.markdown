_I Corinthians 15:57  
But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord
Jesus Christ._

This is Memorial Day, a day that acknowledges those who have given
their lives for their country. Most of us find it hard to acknowledge
God's working in our lives, until we get the victory. We project
defeat more than victory. We are so bound by time and space, that
sometimes it's hard for us to imagine God still doing miracles. It's
been said that miracles only come to those who believe and have
FAITH. Do you need a victory in your life? Claim it right now, and
make a memorial to His FAITHFULNESS! The Lord gives the victory to
those who have FAITH!
