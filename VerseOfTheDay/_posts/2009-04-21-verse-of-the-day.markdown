_Exodus 33:14  
And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee
rest._

When you get close to your wit's end, you will find that God lives
there. He's waiting to give you the peaceful rest that only He can
give. Don't start this day without asking for His presence to go
before you and guide you.
