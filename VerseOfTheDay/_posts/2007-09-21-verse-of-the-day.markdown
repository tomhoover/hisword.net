_I Thessalonians 5:16-18  
16 Rejoice evermore.  
17 Pray without ceasing.  
18 In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ
Jesus concerning you._

Only Christians can truly rejoice with a joy that is "unspeakable
and full of glory," and the secret to experiencing this perpetual
rejoicing spirit is to follow Paul's instruction regarding a
prayerful spirit, "praying always," "without ceasing," and Paul's
instruction regarding a grateful spirit, "in every thing give
thanks." This truly is the will of God for the believer, and without
a relationship with Christ, it is not possible.
