_Deuteronomy 10:12  
And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to
fear thy God, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve
the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul._

Your partnership with God, comes with a job description. What does
God require of you? Respect, obedience, love, and faithful service
are a few of the qualities that God wants to see in your heart today.
God knows that if it's in your heart, it will be revealed in your
words and actions. Do your part to make this a great day!
