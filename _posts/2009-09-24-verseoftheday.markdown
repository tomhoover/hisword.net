title: September 24th - Partnership with God in the Church
---

_Romans 12:10  
Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor
preferring one another._

The challenge for today is "to put others before yourself." This is
called brotherly love. If you are going to remember to do this
throughout your day, you are going to need your Partner's help. Ask
your Partner to give you opportunities today to show brotherly love
to others. Be looking for His hand at work in your life!
