_Psalm 119:86  
All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully;
help thou me._

When you keep God&rsquo;s commandments it can put you at odds with
others. Don&rsquo;t be discouraged, as it is always right to do
right, and God will help you, if you will take a stand for Him. Be
faithful and do right, because God has been and is faithful to you.
