_Psalm 27:5  
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the
secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a
rock._

In previous verses, the LORD was our "high tower" and "LIGHT."
Today, He wants you to find Him in the tabernacle, or your church.
God loves to meet with His children in His church! He gives a special
blessing and encouragement to those who meet together in His name, in
His house. Don't miss that special worship with the Almighty GOD
today! It's out of this world WONDERFUL!
