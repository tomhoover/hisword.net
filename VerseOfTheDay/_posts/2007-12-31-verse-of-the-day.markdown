_II Timothy 3:16-17  
16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness:  
17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all
good works._

Are you thinking about making some New Year&rsquo;s resolutions?
Have you thought about reading your Bible through in 2008? God wants
to be a part of your life, and when you read His Word, He is able to
speak to you. Anyone can be average. Aspire to do something great for
God in 2008!
