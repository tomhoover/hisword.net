_Psalm 147:3  
He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds._

In this world there are broken marriages, broken promises, broken
dreams, broken jobs, broken bank accounts and most of all broken
hearts. Is there anything broken in your life? God is still the
answer for all of things that are broken in life. If you will give
your "broken things" to God, He will put the pieces back together and
make it better than the original.
