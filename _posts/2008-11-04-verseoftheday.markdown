title: November 4th - Partnership with God in Prayer
---

_I Timothy 2:1-2  
1 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers,
intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;  
2 For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a
quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty._

The big day in America has finally arrived. As people all over our
land are casting their votes, pray for Christians to vote biblical
values. God has a plan for our nation and the other nations of this
world. We are commanded to pray for all men in authority, as God
appoints who He wills to accomplish His eternal purpose. Your prayer
for your nation can make a difference!
/"I really believe they (the British) are more afraid of the
Americans' prayers than their swords."/ &ndash; Abigail Adams
(1776)
