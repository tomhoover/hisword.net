_Romans 10:8  
But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in
thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach._

Do you preach "FAITH?" Everyone talks to themselves, whether you
admit it or not! There are days in our lives when we must "preach"
FAITH to ourselves. We must reach down into our heart and build a
fire under our FAITH. Don't just think about it, speak it! Purpose to
speak FAITH throughout this day!
