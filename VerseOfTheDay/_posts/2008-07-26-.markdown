title: July 26th - God&rsquo;s Place of Salvation
---

_Romans 8:31-32  
What shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who can be
against us? He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for
us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?_

Humanly speaking, we can&rsquo;t even begin to understand the love
of God. As you look closer at love, you understand that it must
involve sacrifice to be demonstrated to us. Examine your love for God
and others. Put your own desires aside, and make a sacrifice for God
and others today! God gave His Son for you!
