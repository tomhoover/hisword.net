title: November 18th - God's Place of Healing
---

_Matthew 4:23  
And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and
preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of
sickness and all manner of disease among the people._

Is Jesus still healing the lives of people? Show that you believe
this, by inviting someone to go to church with you today! Pray for
your pastor.
