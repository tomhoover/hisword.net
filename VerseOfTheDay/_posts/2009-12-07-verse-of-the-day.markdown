_Proverbs 14:30  
A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of
the bones._

Did you know that being joyful is good for your heart? On the flip
side of that, if you are envious of others, it's like a cancer to
your bones. Be content with what you have and you'll live longer.
Enjoy the blessings of the season, and put a smile on your face!
You'll live longer! SMILES!
