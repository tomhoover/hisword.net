title: June 30th - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith

_Psalm 121:1-2  
1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
help.  
2 My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth._

No matter what happens in your life, God will be a help to you, if
you will but call upon His name. You cannot change your
circumstances, but you can elevate your FAITH in the One who made
heaven and earth. You can live a beautiful and God-pleasing life in
the midst of your present circumstances! Look up!
