_Deuteronomy 31:8  
And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with
thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither
be dismayed._

This is one of those great promises from God's WORD that will
secure you today! No matter where you go, or what happens to you, He
promises that He goes before you, is with you, and will never leave
you if you are His child. This means FAITH will secure your day!
FAITH activates His promises. FAITH-BOOK: Believing God's WORDS.
