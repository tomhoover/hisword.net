_Song of Solomon 2:4  
He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was
love._

Banners were used in times of war to represent the motto of a group
of people. As we go to God&rsquo;s banqueting house this day, be
reminded that &ldquo;love&rdquo; is written on everything that God
conquers. If you belong to Him, you should display &ldquo;love&rdquo;
in your attitude and actions.
