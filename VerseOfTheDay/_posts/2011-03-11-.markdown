_Hebrews 11:13  
These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced
them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
earth._

One of the most outstanding truths that comes from this verse is
the fact that these people of FAITH lived their lives as pilgrims!
Pilgrims are so persuaded of God's existence, that they are willing
to let go of what they have for something better. Pilgrims have few
possessions, but embrace God's gifts as the real treasures in life.
Pilgrims confess their FAITH in God to be their reason for living on
earth. These pilgrims lived for God's promises having never received
them. It's called FAITH! Are you a pilgrim?
