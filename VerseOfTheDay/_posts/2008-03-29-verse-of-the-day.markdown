title: March 29th - God&rsquo;s Place of Promise
---

_James 2:5  
Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this
world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised
to them that love him?_

Pilgrim, are you weary? God promises that if you love and serve
Him, a better day is coming! Be faithful and strong in Him! You can
do it!
