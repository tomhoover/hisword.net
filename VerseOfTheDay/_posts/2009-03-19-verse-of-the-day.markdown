_Psalm 43:3  
O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring
me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles._

One small candle can light up the darkest room. If you have a
candle close by, light it as a reminder to share your "light"
throughout this day. May God lead you to share your "light" with
someone, telling them of the truth of Jesus Christ and His sacrifice
for their sins.
