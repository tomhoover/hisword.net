_Romans 5:6  
For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for
the ungodly._

You can&rsquo;t do it! You aren&rsquo;t strong enough! Only Jesus
Christ could have endured the cross and died for the sins of the
world! As you think about this truth, make this Easter the most
meaningful ever!
