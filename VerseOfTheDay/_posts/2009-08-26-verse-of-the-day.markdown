_Deuteronomy 15:10  
Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved
when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the Lord thy
God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest
thine hand unto._

Sometimes we don't share what we have with others, because we think
we might really need to save it for ourselves with the economy in such
bad shape. God says that if you will change that thinking, and give to
others, He will bless you more than you can imagine. Will you trust
God or trust your hoarded resources?
