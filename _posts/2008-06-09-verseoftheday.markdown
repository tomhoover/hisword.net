title: June 9th - God&rsquo;s Place of Peace
---

_Romans 5:1  
Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
our Lord Jesus Christ._

Peace originates with God. Imagine what it will be like to live
with God one day in a place of absolute peace, minus sin and
life&rsquo;s problems. You can secure your place in heaven, if you
have asked Jesus to forgive your sins and you have placed your faith
in Him. Faith and peace, go together and make music for the soul.
j Peace, peace, wonderful peace, coming down from the Father
above.....j
