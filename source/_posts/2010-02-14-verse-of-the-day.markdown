_John 15:13  
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for
his friends._

Living in the midst of a large city, there are lots of lonely
people all around you. The usual response on Valentine's Day is to
give an expression of love to a friend, or to those you care about.
What if you gave a Valentine to a lonely person instead? Use this
special day to tell someone about the EXTREME LOVE of Jesus, who gave
His life for all mankind, not just His friends. Make this a special
day for someone in need of a friend!
