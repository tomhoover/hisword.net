_Matthew 7:11  
If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give
good things to them, that ask Him?_

Some people don&rsquo;t pray because they have the wrong image of
God in their mind. They think that God should answer prayer according
to their specifications, and when He doesn't, they stop praying. The
key word in the above verse is "good". As the Senior Partner with all
wisdom, knowledge, and understanding, He alone knows what is "good"
for you. As you pray today, accept what He gives you and understand
that You are God's object of love.
