title: June 26th - God&rsquo;s Place of Peace
---

_Galatians 5:22-23  
22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith,  
23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law._

Have you been enjoying some &ldquo;summer fruit&rdquo; this month?
There&rsquo;s nothing better than fresh fruit right off the tree.
Every day God looks down from heaven wanting to see some &ldquo;fresh
fruit&rdquo; in the lives of His children. It pleases God when you put
&ldquo;His fruit&rdquo; on display in your words and actions. Make
your day exciting and fresh! Put love on your lips; joy and peace on
your face; long-suffering and gentleness in your hands; and goodness,
faith , meekness and self-control in your feet!
