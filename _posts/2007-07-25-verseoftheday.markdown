_John 1:4-8  
4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.  
5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it
not.  
6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.  
7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all
men through him might believe.  
8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that
Light._

In the "Word" (Logos) was life. The power that creates and sustains
life in the universe is the "Word," Jesus Christ. The "Word," who "was
God," is still God now, and He has the power to both give and sustain
life eternally. Jesus is the "Light of the world" that brings life,
and we, like John the Baptist here, are called upon to live and
witness in such a way as to be reflectors of that Light and Life.
