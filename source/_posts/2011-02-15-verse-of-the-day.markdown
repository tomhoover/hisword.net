_John 15:12  
This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved
you._

God loves everyone, and He has commanded for you to do the same.
When you love others, it will cost you something. This might mean you
have to sacrifice your time and pride to show your love for someone.
The primary issue in loving others is to set YOU aside and focus on
others! You can do this when you realize you are constantly secure in
God's love! Ask God to fill your heart with love for ALL! Love is not
just one day a year, but a lifetime for the Christian!
