title: May 21st - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.
---

_Ecclesiastes 7:20  
For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth
not._

Oh no! According to our verse, there is NO ONE upon this earth who
is perfect and that doesn't sin. That includes YOU, and yes, those
people who get under your skin! May this verse challenge you to have
more patience and understanding with the difficult people in your
life. It should also prompt you to humble your heart and confess your
sin.
