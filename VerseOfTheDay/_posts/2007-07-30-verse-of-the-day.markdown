_I Thessalonians 5:5  
Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we
are not of the night, nor of darkness._

We are literally sons of light and sons of day. In Scripture, the
believer's condition is consistently associated with light in the New
Testament. This phrase comes from a Hebrew idiom, and the blessed
meaning is this, that as sons resemble their fathers, so believers
are in character, light, intellectually and morally illuminated to be
able to resemble their heavenly Father.
