_Psalm 27:14  
Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine
heart: wait, I say, on the LORD._

What happens when you run a red light? The same thing that happens
when you do things your way, and don&rsquo;t wait on God&rsquo;s
direction. It&rsquo;s called a wreck! Stop at those red lights today,
it could save your life!
