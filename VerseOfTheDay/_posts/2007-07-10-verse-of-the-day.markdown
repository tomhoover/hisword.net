_Luke 5:31-32  
31 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not
a physician; but they that are sick.  
32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance._

The Jewish leaders Jesus was addressing were too proud to deal with
the spiritual sickness that their sin had caused. They were sin sick,
and by failing to come in repentance and faith to Jesus, the Great
Physician, they died in their sin. The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s ministry
to man is to get them to seek the remedy for their sin, the
righteousness of Jesus Christ. I am a sinner gloriously saved by
grace, are you?
