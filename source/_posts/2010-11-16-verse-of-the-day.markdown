_I Corinthians 3:13  
Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare
it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try
every man's work of what sort it is._

What are your plans for today? Nothing pleases God more than for
His children to serve Him with an humble heart. A humble heart is one
that is motivated to serve God out of love, and not the praise of man.
May your works be FULL of FAITH and pleasing to your heavenly
Father!
