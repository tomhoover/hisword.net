_Romans 12:17  
Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the
sight of all men._

There are times, when after multiple infractions, we can be tempted
to strike back at others. Our verse reminds us that this is not the
Christian attitude! Consider the "grace of God" in your own life. God
doesn't give you what you really deserve, instead, He treats you
better than you deserve. God asks you to not get upset with others,
but to treat all men better than they deserve, for His name sake.
Replace "disgust" with "love and acceptance" in the lives of all men
today!
