_Galatians 5:13  
For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not
liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one
another._

The liberty or freedom that the New Testament speaks of for the
Christian is NEVER a license to live as they please in the flesh, but
a liberty of power to live as they now can in the Spirit. If your
attitude is that you can live and sin as you please because of the
grace of God, you should examine your faith! The grace of God that
saves teaches us "that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world"
(Titus 2:11-12).
