title: May 6th - Partnership with God in Attitude and Mind-Set
---

_I Chronicles 28:9b  
For the Lord searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the
imaginations of the thoughts; if thou seek him, he will be found of
thee._

You just thought no one knew! The first thoughts and concerns of
this day, that went through your mind, are known by God. You can hide
your thoughts and concerns from the people around you, but not God.
He's looking at your heart, and this gives Him the understanding to
help you, if you will but call upon Him. Knowing that God is involved
so intimately in your life should give you an attitude of confidence
and put a smile on your face!
