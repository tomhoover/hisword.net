title: April 24th - Extreme Love...works at overcoming anger.
---

_Proverbs 29:22  
An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in
transgression._

Have you ever regretted something you said as soon as the words
were out of your mouth? You can't take back the words you speak to
others...and words can really make things worse sometimes. Before you
respond to people too quickly, stop, pray, and ask the Holy Spirit to
guide your words and actions. Remember, anger is not just "telling
people off," according to our verse, it's a sin.
