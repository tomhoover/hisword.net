_Luke 24:5-6  
And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth,
they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not
here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in
Galilee?_

FAITH LIFT: This should perk you up! If you are a Christian, you
are "alive" and walking around in the midst of the dead! How is that
encouraging? Everything upon this earth is dead or in the process of
dying. The soul that has been given to Christ, has eternal life, and
is "alive" now and forever! One day you will live forever among only
the living! Now that will be "living it up!" Therefore: Look up!
Don't be fearful and fretting about things in this world! Thank Jesus
for His resurrection day and the better days ahead!
