_Matthew 4:4  
But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread
alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God._

Jesus answered every temptation with Scripture, demonstrating the
power of God's WORD to defeat the evil one. He did not try to use His
own wisdom, or strength, or ingenuity, just the unadulterated WORD of
God. It's a simple action, but a powerful recourse against sin and
temptation. You might need to speak God's WORDS out loud today, to
remind yourself, and the evil one, that God's in control!
