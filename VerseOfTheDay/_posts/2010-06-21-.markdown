title: June 21st - Extreme Love...rejoices in truth.
---

_Proverbs 8:17  
I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find
me._

Our verse isn't saying that you have to get up early in the morning
to spend time with God, although that really is a good way to start
your day. Instead, it's talking about putting God at the apex (the
highest point) of your life, whether it's the beginning of a day or
the end. He wants all of your day! It's talking about a LOVE
relationship, where you seek out the One you love and focus on Him.
God loves you today. May you love Him back!
