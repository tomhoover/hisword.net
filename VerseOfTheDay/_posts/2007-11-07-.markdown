title: November 7th - God's Place of Healing
---

_James 5:16  
Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that
ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man
availeth much._

Instead of praying just for yourself today, focus on a needy
friend, and pray for them fervently throughout the day.
