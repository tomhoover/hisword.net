_James 3:2  
For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the
same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body._

If words are really so powerful, why are we so careless with them?
As you start your day, ask God to help you use your words to build up
others, not tear them down. Be careful what you say, the Father up
above is looking down to see your love!
