title: September 9th - Extreme Love...endures through trials.
---

_I Peter 4:12-13  
Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to
try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: But rejoice,
inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his
glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy._

The Christian life is not meant to be a sit down, take it easy,
"don't do nuthin'" life! In fact, when Christians do that, God most
of the time gives them a nudge. He has a growth program for every
believer that will include trials. Therefore don't think it strange
when trials surface in your life. Instead, be joyous as our verse
reminds you, because when you grow through these trials, you are
becoming more like HIM!
