_Isaiah 40:30-31  
30 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall
utterly fall:  
31 But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they
shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary;
and they shall walk, and not faint._

Our verse reminds us that there will never be a day upon this earth
that your faith will not be challenged, whether you are young or old.
The key lies in daily strengthening your faith, through spending time
with the Lord. Whether you run like a young person, or walk as an
older person, with God by your side, you can soar like an eagle, and
keep going!
