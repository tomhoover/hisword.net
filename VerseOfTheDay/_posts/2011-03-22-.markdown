_Hebrews 11:32-34  
And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of
Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also,
and Samuel, and of the prophets: Who through faith subdued kingdoms,
wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of
lions, Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,
out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to
flight the armies of the aliens._

It just can't be said enough! FAITH pleases God! It's amazing that
God takes a whole chapter to list individuals, as well as the
categories of people, who had great FAITH! God wants you to know just
how important the FAITH of previous generations are to the next
generation. There is someone coming behind you who will be affected
by your FAITH! Stop and ask God to keep your FAITH strong and
focused!
