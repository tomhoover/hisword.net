_Luke 2:10-11  
And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you
good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you
is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the
Lord._

Happy Birthday, JESUS! There was no better news upon this earth
than the day the angel announced You had finally arrived! It was
great JOY then, and it still is today! Thank You, Emmanuel, for
coming to dwell with us. You are the Christ, and we look forward to
YOUR return to this earth again. Come quickly, Lord Jesus, please
hear Your children praying!
