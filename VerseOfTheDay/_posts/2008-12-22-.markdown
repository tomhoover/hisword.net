_II Corinthians 8:9  
For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was
rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty
might be rich._

Most people in the USA are considered to be rich compared to many
foreign countries. Spiritual poverty, however, can be found
worldwide. If you have given your heart to Jesus, you are rich in the
greatest way! Share your wealth with a lost world! Tell someone about
Jesus today!
