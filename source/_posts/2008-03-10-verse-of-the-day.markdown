_Titus 1:2  
In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before
the world began._

God made a promise to YOU before the world was created and before
YOU were born. Have you embraced Jesus, the only hope of eternal
life? If you have, ask God to use you to share that hope with someone
else today.
