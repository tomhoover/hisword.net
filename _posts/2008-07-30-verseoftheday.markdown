title: July 30th - God&rsquo;s Place of Salvation
---

_Ephesians 6:17  
And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which
is the word of God._

Are you wearing your helmet and sword? These are part of the
weapons that the Christian is told to put on every day. If you have
the Word of God in your mind it will protect you from evil thoughts,
being offended, and offending others. You are in a spiritual war and
only God&rsquo;s weapons are effective. Don&rsquo;t do anything until
you protect your mind with God&rsquo;s Word.
