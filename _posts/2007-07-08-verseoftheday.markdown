_II Samuel 22:29  
For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my
darkness._

When you awake in the middle of the night and there is no night
light on, you don't walk at normal speed do you? That could be
dangerous to your health. A child of God endangers his spiritual
health when he neglects the light God has provided through His Word,
His Spirit, His church, and His gift of prayer, choosing rather the
dimness of the world&rsquo;s light instead. Walk in the light and
walk with confidence.
