_Hebrews 4:16  
Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may
obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need._

Help! Do you need some help? You've got help on the way as quick as
offering up a prayer to God! It is a huge comfort to know that you get
a "grace transfusion" when you are hooked up with God. "Your worst
days are never so bad that you are beyond the reach of God's grace.
And your best days are never so good that you are beyond the need of
God's grace." That's why you need to start off every day praying for
God's grace and mercy in your life!
