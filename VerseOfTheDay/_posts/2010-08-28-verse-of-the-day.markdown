_Psalm 38:15  
For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God._

David wrote this psalm to be sung as a song of remembrance. He was
recalling the times when he had put his HOPE in the LORD, and God had
delivered him. Can you also recall a time when God delivered you? Will
your HOPE become a song today? They say that those who wish to sing,
can always find a song.
