_I Peter 1:3  
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively
hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead._

In just a few days, United States income taxes will become due!
They say taxes are as certain as death! However, death is absolutely
more certain for those who don't believe in Jesus Christ as Savior.
Taxes can be avoided for a limited period of time, but not death!
Christian, you are blessed with a special "exemption!" Don't worry,
this "exemption" will never be repealed by a legislature! Your FAITH
and HOPE were eternally secured through the death and resurrection of
Jesus Christ. Don't neglect your taxes, or the opportunity to praise
God for your "eternal exemption!"
