title: August 20th - Extreme Love...hopes and believes the best.

_Psalm 119:116  
Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not
be ashamed of my hope._

Someone said, "Hope is putting faith to work, when doubting would
be easier." Natural tendencies to see the dark side of things is the
easy way out, most of the time. When you do stand up and voice your
HOPE, it can be hard if you are ridiculed. Don't let the world
silence your HOPE! You have the authority of God's Word to back you
up, and God has proven that He keeps His promises. Speak HOPE, a
listening world needs to hear your voice today.
