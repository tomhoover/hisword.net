_Psalm 133:1  
Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
together in unity!_

Charles de Gaulle said, "Only peril can bring the French together.
One can't impose unity out of the blue, on a country that has 265
different kinds of cheese." The church is made up of people of
different ages, different nationalities, and different opinions.
However, we must remind everyone that we all have Jesus Christ in
common, and we can be united in Him. Celebrate what you have in
common with those of like faith!
P.S. Aren&rsquo;t you glad there&rsquo;s more than one kind of
cheese?
