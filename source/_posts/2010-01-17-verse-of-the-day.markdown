_Luke 6:32  
For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners
also love those that love them._

What is it that makes us hesitant to make new friends? It could be
a fear of rejection, or maybe we just don't enjoy being around people
who are different from us. Both of those excuses come out of an
obsession with self. Anyone can love those who love them or who are
like them, but the challenge is to develop EXTREME LOVE in our lives.
If you are secure in God's love, you can put "self" aside, and reach
out to even the unlovely. Make a new friend today!
