title: June 1st - Extreme Love...rejoices in truth.
---

_I Corinthians 13:6  
Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth._

Rejoice! There is nothing ordinary about the God of the Bible! His
EXTREME LOVE, offers every believer the possibility of JOY, no matter
their circumstances. God reminds you in our verse that if you are to
rejoice, your focus must be upon Him, upon His TRUTH, not the sinful
things of this world. Will you be able to rejoice today, no matter
what comes your way? This extraordinary God we serve leaves that up
to you! You can have an ordinary day, or it can be extraordinary!
Rejoice in GOD'S EXTREME LOVE!
