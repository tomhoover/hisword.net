title: March 12th - Extreme Love...is giving.
---

_Romans 12:16  
Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but
condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits._

If you have a desire to be more like Jesus, you will not think upon
yourself as being better or above others. Christian brothers and
sisters should serve the Lord shoulder to shoulder. You can't help
another Christian, until you humble yourself, and put their needs on
an equal plane with your own. Extreme love will find you going even
further, wanting others to profit above yourself. Take the
challenge!
