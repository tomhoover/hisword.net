_I Thessalonians 5:14b  
...be patient toward all men._

Most people don't enjoy sitting in rush hour traffic and going
nowhere. Most people don't enjoy waiting on other people to get ready
to leave the house. Why couldn't you be different? Instead of looking
at it as wasted time, keep your Bible close by and share a sweet time
with your Lord! Your smile will come back, and the watching world will
see that you are different!
