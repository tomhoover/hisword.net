_Mark 10:43-45  
43 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great
among you, shall be your minister:  
44 And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of
all.  
45 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
minister, and to give his life a ransom for many._

Your Partner, Jesus Christ, has set an example for you. If He were
on earth today, He would be the One who lets everyone in front of Him
at the supermarket. He would be the One who gives money to an
undeserving soul. He would give the shirt off His back, if someone
needed it. Jesus Christ came giving....forgiveness, hope and love.
Would you be like Him today?
