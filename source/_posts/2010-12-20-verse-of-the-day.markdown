_I Thessalonians 5:5  
Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we
are not of the night, nor of darkness._

Christians are to be people of the LIGHT! What does that mean to
you? It could mean you are truthful, honest, hard-working, and
committed to keeping God's commandments. It could mean you wouldn't
do anything that, if revealed, would make God look bad. Stay in the
LIGHT today, and give God the gift of a pure life.
