_I Timothy 6:12  
Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto
thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before
many witnesses. _

Are you tired today? Would you like a day off from being a
Christian? The good fight of faith is a 24/7 battle. There is someone
watching your life today, so bow your head and ask God to help you
represent Him faithfully. Someone&rsquo;s eternity could be at
stake.
