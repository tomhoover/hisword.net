title: May 7th - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.

_II Timothy 1:7  
For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
love, and of a sound mind._

This verse makes two very important statements. The first is that
we all have fear in our lives, but FEAR DOES NOT come from God, nor
does He want you to have it. Second, God HAS given you three things:
POWER through Him, LOVE through Him, and a SOUND MIND through Him.
All three of these things will help you overcome fear in your life.
Personalize this verse and embrace it. Ask the Holy Spirit to remind
you of your three resources. If you do this, it will change your
life!
