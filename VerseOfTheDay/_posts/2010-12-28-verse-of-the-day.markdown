_I John 1:5  
This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare
unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all._

It is quite a comfort to know that you don't have to be perfect!
You do have to be forgiven though, if you want to live with God one
day! God sent the only perfect LIGHT to die for the sins of the
imperfect. Have you embraced the LIGHT of His message? It's called
FAITH-LIGHT, and it repels the darkness!
