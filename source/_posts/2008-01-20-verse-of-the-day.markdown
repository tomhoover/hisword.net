_Philippians 3:10  
That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the
fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his
death._

Set aside five whole minutes sometime during this day, to have a
special time with Jesus. Talk and listen, like a best friend. Get to
know Him. You might be surprised how His power will surface in other
relationships.
