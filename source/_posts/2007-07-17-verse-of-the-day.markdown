_Isaiah 9:2  
The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they
that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the
light shined._

This speaks specifically of the world&rsquo;s nations seeing and
coming to the Light, Jesus Christ, as He walked the earth. What a
privilege it is to have seen and to have come to Jesus as Savior and
Lord. Sin&rsquo;s shadow of death no longer has any power or claim on
my life as Jesus Christ the Light has translated me as a believer from
the Kingdom of darkness into the Kingdom of His Dear Son. There is no
darkness in the Son-Light.
