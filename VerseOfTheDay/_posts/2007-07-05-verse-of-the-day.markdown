_Matthew 5:14-16  
14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
cannot be hid.  
15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a
candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.  
16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven._

The "ye" here are the disciples of Christ, those who are earnestly
seeking to surrender their lives to Christ as His learner/follower.
The only way to be a light to the world is to get ourselves out of
the way by becoming the servants of Christ, living in obedience and
faithfulness to the Word of God, by the power of the Spirit of God,
through the institution of Church of God.
