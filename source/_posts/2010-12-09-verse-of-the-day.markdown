_Micah 7:8  
Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise;
when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me._

This time of the year can be sad or difficult for some people. The
prophet reminds us that we don't need to sit in darkness, the LIGHT
has come to brighten our lives! FAITH is like the bird that sings in
the dark of the night, knowing that dawn's LIGHT is about to break
through. Arise! Rejoice! FAITH sees the LIGHT in the midst of
darkness.
