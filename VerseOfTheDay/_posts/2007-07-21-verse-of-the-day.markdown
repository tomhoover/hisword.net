_Psalm 20:1-2  
1 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of
Jacob defend thee;  
2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of
Zion;_

There are many man-made gods, but only one "God of Jacob." It is
the God of the Bible, in the person of Jesus Christ, God the Son,
that hears us in our time of trouble. The Christian is not dependent
on the nebulous concept of God from the imaginations of man, but on
an identifiable and knowable God who has revealed Himself to man
through His Word and through His Son (The Word). He hears, He weeps,
He knows and He cares.
