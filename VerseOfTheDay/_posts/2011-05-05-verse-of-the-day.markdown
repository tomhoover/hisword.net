title: May 5th - FaithSearch...examining your Faith in the midst of life's
---

_II Corinthians 4:18  
While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things
which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but
the things which are not seen are eternal._

If only God would give Christians "reality glasses" after they give
their hearts to Him! Every time you felt overwhelmed, you could put
them on, and see the "real things" of importance in life. You would
be able to see the result of a long term FAITH and commitment to God!
Wouldn't that be great? Answer that question with an action on your
part. Pray for eyes to see the eternal, not the earthly! Every day
should be a national day of PRAYER in this nation!
