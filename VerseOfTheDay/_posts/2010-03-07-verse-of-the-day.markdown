_John 3:16  
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life._

Love is most often measured by its gifts. There are three things in
this verse that tells us about how God gives, and how you can give.
1. God made a sacrifice. Your giving will require a personal
sacrifice.
2. God gave, not requiring works. Your gift must be free, not based
upon what you get out of it.
3. Jesus gave His life for the whole world. Your giving must include
everyone, excluding no one.
Do you need to be a better "giver?"
