title: April 13th - Partnership with God for a Victorious Life
---

_Colossians 3:15  
And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye
are called in one body; and be ye thankful._

If you have a thankful heart, it is more likely that you will also
have a peaceful heart. When you can actually come to the place where
you can "thank" God for EVERYTHING (the good and the bad) in your
life, it will give you peace. If you are struggling with this, ask
God to help you get the victory over life's struggles.
