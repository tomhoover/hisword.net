_John 14:21  
He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that
loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I
will love him, and will manifest myself to him._

This is the key to an abundant life, an intimate relationship with
Jesus Christ! The one thing needed to have this relationship is to
love Him. The evidence that you actually love Him is that you keep
His commandments. In other words, your life and the choices thereof
are not founded and motivated by this world&rsquo;s system, or even
by your brothers' and sisters', in Christ, choices; but it is founded
and motivated by "Thus saith the Lord," by hearing the Word of God and
obeying it.
