_Ecclesiastes 3:11  
He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the
world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God
maketh from the beginning to the end._

Have you noticed that you live in a "beautiful" world? Life is
absolutely too short to view it any differently! You can argue with
God about the things in your life that are unpleasant, or you can
chose to see the "beauty!" A strong FAITH in God will help you see
His "beauty" and all the wonderful blessings that you have! Don't
waste your life! Smile as you walk through God's beautiful world
today!
