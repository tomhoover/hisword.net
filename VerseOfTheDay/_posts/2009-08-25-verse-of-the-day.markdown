_Galatians 5:1  
Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us
free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage._

After you give your heart to Jesus, you can be tempted to go back
to some of your previous sinful ways. Our verse says, that if you do
that, it's like you are in prison. Change your life instead, and
become more like Christ! WWJD? He would love ALL people and tell them
how to be free!
