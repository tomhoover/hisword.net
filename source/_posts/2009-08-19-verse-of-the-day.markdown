_Psalm 51:10  
Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within
me._

There's nothing better than feeling clean! A clean heart comes from
asking God to forgive your sin. The bad thoughts, the lazy mind, the
deceitful tongue, are just a few of the things that can keep you from
having a "right spirit" with God. Confessing your sin is like a shower
of cleansing. It makes you feel so good inside! Turn on the water!
