_Job 11:18  
And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig
about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety._

The media is constantly making us aware of all the many ways a
person can die or be harmed. If you were to listen to it too much,
you might become fearful and insecure. Job reminds us that the only
place we are safe and secure is in our relationship with God. He
encourages us to imagine ourselves in a setting with God being all
about and around us. Nothing can get past God's arms of safety. Take
this image of God with you in your mind today, and walk with courage
and boldness!
