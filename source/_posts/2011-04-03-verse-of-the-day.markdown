_John 11:25-26  
Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that
believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And
whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou
this?_

Boxes bring wonderful order to our lives. They hold things, and
this makes us feel secure. FAITH is security outside a box. Jesus is
telling Martha, that as Savior of the world, He cannot, and will not,
be put in a box of limitations. He is not going to be contained in an
earthly grave, and those who believe in Him, will not as well!
Martha's brother would be delivered from his box. Do you need
deliverance in your life? Whatever the crisis in your life, God's
POWER is limitless WHEN you choose FAITH!
