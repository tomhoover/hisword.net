_John 15:11-13  
11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in
you, and that your joy might be full.  
12 This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved
you.  
13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life
for his friends._

The principle here is simple, yet ironic. Jesus isn't calling us to
die for Him, but to live for Him; yet in order to live for Him, we
must die to self, by crucifixion. Paul states it in this well quoted
verse, "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,
but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I
live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself
for me." Dying to self and living for Christ is what is meant by
carrying your cross.
