_I Kings 3:13a  
And I have also given thee, that which thou hast not asked._

Have you received a blessing from the Lord lately that totally
surprised you? That's just like our God! When you surrender to His
will, you are putting yourself in a position where God can open the
windows of heaven on your behalf. As you pray today bow your heart as
well as your head, and thank Him for being absolutely the best friend
and partner for this life!
