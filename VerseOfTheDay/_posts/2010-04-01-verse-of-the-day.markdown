title: April 1st - Extreme Love...works at overcoming anger.
---

_I Corinthians 13:5c  
...is not easily provoked..._

Extreme love challenges us to not give into Satan's tactics to get
us upset and angry with people, or about things, that will not matter
in eternity. Satan will be sure to send thoughts to keep you stirred
up and thinking on the wrong things. When those thoughts come to
mind, say a prayer and ask God to replace your anger and frustration
with His long-suffering Extreme Love. You need God's help today if
you are going to allow His love to flow through you! No Foolin!
