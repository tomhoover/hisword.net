_I John 5:14  
And this is the confidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask
anything according to His will, He heareth us._

It is comforting to know that God can be involved in your life
today. When you take the time to lay out your day before Him, He
faithfully listens and answers your prayers according to what is best
for you. There are many unseen dangers, that God in His foreknowledge,
will protect you from, when you ask for His help. You can go
everywhere today in the confidence of His care!
