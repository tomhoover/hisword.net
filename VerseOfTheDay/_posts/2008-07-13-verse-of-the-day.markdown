_Romans 10:9  
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
believe in thy heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou
shalt be saved._

Do you need someone in your life who really cares about you? Jesus
has told us that if you ask Him into your life as your Savior, He
will save your soul. After salvation, Jesus wants to be involved in
every part of your life. Jesus cares about YOU, and wants an intimate
relationship with you! Call upon Him!
