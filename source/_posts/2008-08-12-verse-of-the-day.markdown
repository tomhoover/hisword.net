_Matthew 17:20b  
If ye have faith, as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this
mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and
nothing shall be impossible to you._

When you pray, do you pray believing? It&rsquo;s not the size of
your faith that gets God&rsquo;s attention. It&rsquo;s not that you
have great faith; it&rsquo;s that you have absolute faith in a GREAT
GOD! Take your burden to God, believing!
