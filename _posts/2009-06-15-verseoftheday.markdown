title: June 15th - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith
---

_Proverbs 1:33  
But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet
from fear of evil._

It's Monday! Mondays can be challenging if you haven't prepared
your heart and mind. Ask the Lord to protect you wherever you go and
to keep you from evil. This is going to be a great day with God as
your partner. He promises to hear and respond to your prayers, but
you must do your part, strengthening your heart through PRAYER!
