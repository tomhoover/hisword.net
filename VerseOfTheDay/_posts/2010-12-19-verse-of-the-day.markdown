---

_Psalm 99:9  
Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD
our God is holy._

It's getting pretty close to Christmas. Have you kept your focus on
Jesus? Before you start your day, fall at the foot of the cross, and
thank God the Father for sending His Son to give LIGHT to this dark
world. Give yourself an early present and celebrate a FAITHFUL God!
