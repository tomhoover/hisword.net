_II Peter 1:19  
We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that
ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the
day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts._

Isn't the Word of God marvelous? It is like a brilliant LIGHT in a
dark room. It pushes out the fear of the unknown. Through God's Word
we are told that the Day Star, LIGHT of the world, Jesus Christ, will
come and shine in your hearts, if you but invite Him in. One day this
same LIGHT will split open the heavens and all darkness will flee. If
you know Jesus, this will be a wonderful day!
