title: December 19th - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_II Peter 2:3a  
And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
merchandise of you._

Beware! The ole devil has some smooth-talking salesmen out there
trying to entice you to buy things that you don't really need. Pray
over all your purchases throughout this Christmas season, and ask God
to protect you from the persuasive words of the world. Remember your
JOY comes from the Lord, not pleasing people.
