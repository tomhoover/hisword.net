title: January 9th - Partnership with God in Daily Disciplines
---

_Galatians 6:9  
And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall
reap, if we faint not._

It's easier to do the right thing and have discipline when you can
see the difference it is making in your life. When things don&rsquo;t
happen quickly, it's easy to get discouraged. Your Partner reminds you
to not quit TODAY, as success is guaranteed if you keep doing right
and fix your eyes on Him. (This is also called, "Don&rsquo;t break
the chain!" One day builds on another. You can't quit today because
you added a link yesterday. You only have to keep your goal one day
at a time to be successful!)
