_Galatians 2:20  
I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but
Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I
live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself
for me._

Having FAITH in the midst of a world of turmoil is very
challenging! When the media constantly projects "negative situations"
and "fears" throughout the world, it can be hard to keep your FAITH
FULL. Our verse today reminds us that the strength to keep FAITH in
God as our focus comes from Jesus Christ. If you will take the time
every morning to ask Jesus to fill you with FAITH, it will make the
difference in your day! Don't run on empty. Fill up before you run
out of fuel.
