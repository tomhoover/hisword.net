_Isaiah 43:2  
When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest
through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame
kindle upon thee._

One of the most amazing promises to the servant of Christ is His
ever-abiding and never-changing presence. If you are going though
life's fire or seemingly drowning in life's waters, God is there in
the center. Just as great is the promise that when God leads us
through the fire or up out of the water, we come out better than
before we entered.
