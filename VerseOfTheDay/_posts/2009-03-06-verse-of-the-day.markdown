_Zechariah 8:16  
These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth
to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your
gates._

You have been placed where you are in this world with purpose.
There are people in your life, that only you can touch. God is
counting on you to share His truth and peace with them. Friends?
Neighbors? Family? Work associates? Who is it? It's all of them!
You're going to be busy today!
