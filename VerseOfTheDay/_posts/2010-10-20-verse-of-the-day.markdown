_Romans 1:17  
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith._

Whether you like it or not, God made human beings to be dependent
upon Him. You need FAITH in your life! There are things that, humanly
speaking, are beyond you! FAITH in God will give you the FAITH in
yourself to be able to step into the future! FAITH to FAITH. It's
like walking to the top of a steep staircase and putting your weight
on the step that is totally invisible to your eyes, without holding
on to the rails. Is your FAITH in God or yourself? Are you "holding
on," just in case, or are you "letting go?"
