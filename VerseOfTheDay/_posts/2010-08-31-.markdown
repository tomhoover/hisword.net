title: August 31st - Extreme Love...hopes and believes the best.
---

_I Corinthians 13:13  
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest
of these is charity._

You absolutely need FAITH! You must have HOPE! But where would you
be without LOVE? There would be no FAITH or HOPE apart from the
EXTREME LOVE of God! If God wants you to be conformed to the image of
His Son, and He describes Himself as LOVE, then the greatest thing you
can have in your life is LOVE! LOVE is the proof of FAITH, HOPE and
CHRIST in your heart. Do you have EXTREME LOVE for others?
