_John 16:33  
These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace.
In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have
overcome the world._

You know those burdens you've been carrying around lately? The Lord
wants to remind you that He has overcome the world and all the forces
of evil. When you give those burdens to the Lord, He will give you
peace. The problem is, as long as you are in the world, you will have
to KEEP giving Him your burdens, over and over. The Lord wants to
encourage you once more, that He alone is the answer for PEACE in
this lifetime.
