title: July 24th - God&rsquo;s Place of Salvation
---

_Ezekiel 33:11  
Say unto them, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in
the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and
live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will you die, O
house of Israel?_

It&rsquo;s God desire for everyone to have an opportunity to accept
Him as their personal Savior. Tell someone about Jesus today. YOU
could be the only person on the face of this earth who would take the
time to tell them!
