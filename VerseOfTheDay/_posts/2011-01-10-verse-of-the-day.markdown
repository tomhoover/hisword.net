_I Peter 1:25  
But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word
which by the gospel is preached unto you._

Can you imagine anything you can presently see enduring forever?
There is nothing on this earth that is not in the process of aging
and destruction, apart from the WORDS of God. In fact you will hear
God's WORDS after you leave this earth. With this in mind, it seems
that a wise person would act on them while he can. Put your FAITH in
Jesus! He alone can save!
