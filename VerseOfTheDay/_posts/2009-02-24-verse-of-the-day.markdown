_Luke 10:27  
And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all
thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself._

This verse is part of an answer to a lawyer who asked what he must
do to have eternal life. If you love God with your whole being
(heart, soul, strength, and mind), it will bring about a change in
you. You will love your neighbor differently. You will want to
provide for his needs as you would your own. Who is your neighbor?
Your neighbor is everyone!
