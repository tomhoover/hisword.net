_Psalm 90:1-2  
1 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.  
2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed
the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou
art God._

Are you ready for a fresh start? Has God shown you some things in
your life lately that you need to change? God is still creating. He
wants to be involved in creating needed changes in your life!
