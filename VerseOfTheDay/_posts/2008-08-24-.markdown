title: August 24th - God&rsquo;s Place of Faithfulness
---

_I Corinthians 1:9  
God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of His
Son Jesus Christ our Lord._

As you go to church today and fellowship with other believers,
elevate your conversation, to include Jesus Christ. Don&rsquo;t
forget that you go to church to worship Him first, and fellowship
with believers second.
