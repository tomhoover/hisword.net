_II Thessalonians 1:3  
We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet,
because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every
one of you all toward each other aboundeth._

There it is! In our verse, we are given a picture of people who
were so FULL of FAITH, that it overflowed and impacted others. Their
relationship, FAITH in God, made them secure enough to love EVERYONE.
A growing FAITH will take you places that you never imagined! Trust
God! He wants to give you His best!
