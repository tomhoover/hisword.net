_Isaiah 12:2  
Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for
the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my
salvation._

Someone pictured FAITH as a little bird sitting in its nest in a
tree, resting and singing in the midst of a bad storm. The bird knows
that if he gets blown out of the tree, he will be able to fly away.
When you put your FAITH in God and rest in Him, you can know that you
are totally safe in every situation, until He's ready for you to fly
away to be with Him. Faith becomes a winner in every situation of
life! Now what about that song? Do you have His song in your heart
today? Rest in His arms and sing "Blessed Assurance, Jesus is
mine!"
