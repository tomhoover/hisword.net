_Matthew 5:7  
Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy._

Are you merciful? The merciful are those who have compassion on
someone who deserves condemnation. If you aren't merciful, then you
are reminded that you will not be in line to receive mercy from God
and others. Can you afford to not be merciful, today? Ask God to help
you have "eyes of mercy" for all those with whom you come in
contact.
