_Psalm 36:9  
For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see
light._

Life could not be sustained upon this earth without the light of
the sun. This same principle applies to the inward part of every
human being. Your life is nothing without the LIGHT of the SON, Jesus
Christ! Take a moment today to look at the sun and the SON. They are
both imperative for life! Don't just exist! Live in rooms FULL of HIS
LIGHT!
