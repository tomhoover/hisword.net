title: September 20th - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Luke 23:34  
Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
do. And they parted his raiment and cast lots._

Jesus' very public words asking the Father to forgive those
involved in His crucifixion were for you, not God. It's God's nature
to love and forgive even the undeserving, but it is not man's nature
to do this. When someone wrongs you today, may you hear the words of
our Savior, "Forgive them!"
