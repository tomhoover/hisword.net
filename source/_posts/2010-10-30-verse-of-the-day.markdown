_Romans 5:1  
Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
our Lord Jesus Christ._

Need some peace in your life today? Believe it or not, your peace
is connected to your FAITH! Minus FAITH you are ruled by FEAR. When
your life is lived in fear, there will be no peace. FAITH is seeing
God walking with you and going ahead of you to work out your
problems. A peaceful day begins with a decision to put your FAITH in
God!
