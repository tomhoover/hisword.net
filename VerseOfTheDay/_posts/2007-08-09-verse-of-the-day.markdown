_John 10:14  
I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine._

Our consideration of Jesus as the Good Shepherd this month
naturally takes us back to John 10. Today the emphasis is the fact
that as your Shepherd, Jesus, knows you intimately and cares for you
intensely, and because of your personal faith in Him, you may know
Him intimately and love Him intensely as well. Jesus tells His
disciples in John 14, that if we keep His commandments by walking in
obedience to Him, He will abide with us, meaning that our
relationship with Him will grow deeper and more intimate. Wow!
