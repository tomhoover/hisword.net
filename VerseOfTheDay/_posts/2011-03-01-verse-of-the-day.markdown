_Hebrews 12:1  
Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud
of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth
so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set
before us._

This verse flows out of chapter eleven, where God has listed a few
of the people who had great FAITH. Those who lived in New Testament
days didn't make this list, but you can be sure there was a great
number added from those days. There are names still being added to
the FAITH list. In fact, you can still make that list if you
patiently ENDURE! It's called FAITH-LINE, a continual line of people
who have put their FAITH in GOD to this present day. Keep the FAITH
going!
