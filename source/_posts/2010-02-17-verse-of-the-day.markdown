_Ephesians 2:8  
For by grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves,
it is the gift of God._

Although your salvation is a gift from God, you have been given the
will to accept or reject God's Son, Jesus Christ. God's grace has
given everyone upon this earth an opportunity to believe in Him. Man
was born broken, and he is in need of someone to put him back
together. God's grace is the glue, that if applied will make a life
whole. Will you tell someone about God's gift today?
