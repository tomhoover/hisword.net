title: October 23rd - The Basics of Partnership
---

_Psalm 68:19  
Blessed be the Lord who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God
of our salvation._

When you enter into this partnership with God, you soon realize
that it is like none other! God gives you overtime pay you don't work
for, and when you deserve to get docked, He blesses you and pays you
time and a half! Have you thanked God for all the benefits He
provides for you? Think about this and smile, when your world seems
unfair.
