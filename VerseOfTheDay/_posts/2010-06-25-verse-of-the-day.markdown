title: June 25th - Extreme Love...rejoices in truth.
---

_John 17:17  
Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth._

This verse is part of Christ's prayer. He is praying, and at the
same time, teaching His followers that they should live holy lives
that would magnify and glorify TRUTH. How does that work out in your
life today? That means your speech and actions should reflect that
Jesus Christ is truly the Lord of your life. EXTREME LOVE!
