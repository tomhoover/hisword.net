_Isaiah 42:16  
And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead
them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light
before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto
them, and not forsake them._

The context is God's judgment, and yet in the midst of it, the
prophet reveals the tender mercy of God to redeem those who have
saving faith in Him. The "blind" are those who have been deprived of
sight by their sin, and the consequent punishment. They will receive
their spiritual sight by faith in God who will lead them and never
leave them.
