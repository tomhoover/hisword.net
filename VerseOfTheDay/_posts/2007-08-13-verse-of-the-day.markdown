_John 10:27  
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me._

A sheep doesn't have to see the shepherd to follow him, he knows
his voice. He knows its pitch, its tone, and its volume; he knows it
intimately. The sound of his voice is his greatest peace. As a
believer, you can hear Jesus' voice, if you&rsquo;re listening. It is
not loud and boisterous; it is not burdensome; it is calm and easy to
listen to; it is the "still, small voice." He speaks to your hearts
as a believer in a way that an unbeliever can never hear.
