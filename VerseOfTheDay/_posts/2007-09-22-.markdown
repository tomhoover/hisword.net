_Psalm 84:11  
For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory:
no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly._

Wow! What blessings does the Christian have that the unbeliever
misses out on? GOD'S GRACE AND GOD'S GLORY! That covers everything we
could ever need or want. By receiving the free gift of God's grace in
Christ, we are partakers of God&rsquo;s glory in the same. And what a
future we have: "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for
them that love him."
