_II Corinthians 5:17  
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things
are passed away; behold all things are become new._

Okay, this is the day! Take the challenge of faith and branch out
and do something new for the Lord. Christians should be taking off
bad habits and putting on new godly ways every day of their lives.
Are you stuck in a rut? The Holy Spirit will bring something to mind,
if you will but stop and listen.
