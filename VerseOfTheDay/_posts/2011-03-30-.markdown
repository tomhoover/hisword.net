_I Corinthians 10:11  
Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are
written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are
come._

Have you ever thought you were the only one to step foot in a
certain place, only to discover an empty Coke can lying nearby? Put
it down, someone has been there and done that, before you were ever
born. This is one of the great benefits of reading your Bible. You
will find the testimonies of good people and bad people; the smart
things they did, and the not so smart things. Learn from their lives,
and it will save you a lot of heartache. Oh yes! Don't litter. Pick up
those Coke cans!
