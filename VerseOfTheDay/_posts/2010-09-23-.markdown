_Psalm 19:14  
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer._

Have you heard yourself complaining lately? Has sarcasm and
negativity flavored your conversations? Think about some of
yesterday's conversations. Guilty!! This can easily become a pattern
if you aren't mindful of your speech. Our verse is actually a prayer
to God for strength and wisdom to say the right things! It is a good
verse to memorize and pray every morning before you start your day!
