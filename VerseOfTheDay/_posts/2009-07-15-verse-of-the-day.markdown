_Luke 9:23  
And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me._

When you have a moment to yourself, what is your favorite thing to
do? Would you consider not indulging yourself today, and instead give
your personal time, energy, or money to God instead? Would you deny
yourself and spend some time talking to your Savior?
