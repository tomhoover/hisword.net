_Philippians 2:4  
Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the
things of others. _

The first of the year can find you financially challenged to pay
all those bills that come due in the month of January. That's why the
challenge to give up something of your own to help someone else, can
seem EXTREME! Keep in mind that others have the same financial
struggles that you have. May EXTREME LOVE guide your heart and life
today. May you have the faith to trust God to supply your own needs,
when you put the needs of others before your own.
