title: July 2nd - Partnership with God in Sacrifice
---

_Romans 12:1  
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable service._

If you will but think upon God's mercy in your life, it should move
you to want to give back to Him. Prepare your heart and open your eyes
to serve Him today. It's your reasonable service.
