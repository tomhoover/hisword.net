_John 6:47  
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
everlasting life._

It&rsquo;s a sure thing! If you&rsquo;ve given your heart to Jesus,
you have everlasting life. There&rsquo;s not too many sure things
these days, but God&rsquo;s forgiveness is still the best deal in
this life. This will even make you smile on Monday morning, when you
aren&rsquo;t too sure how you will get all your work done!
