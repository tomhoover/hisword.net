title: January 18th - Extreme Love...Is not proud or self-focused
---

_Philippians 2:21  
For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's._

There will always be a struggle in your spiritual walk with the
Lord. If you are going to be close to the Lord, it will take a daily
effort on your part. The Adversary will be sure that there are plenty
of temptations to lure you away from focusing upon the Lord. It would
be good to start every day with a prayer for help to deny self. Be
the exception, live above worldly desires and focus on Jesus Christ
today! EXTREME LOVE calls for extreme measures!
