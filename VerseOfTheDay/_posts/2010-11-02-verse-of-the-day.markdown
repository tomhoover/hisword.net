_Luke 12:27-28  
Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and
yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like
one of these. If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the
field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he
clothe you, O ye of little faith?_

In this uncertain economy, children of God can be overcome at times
with fear, IF they factor out GOD! Sometimes God must get frustrated
WHEN all the plants and animals He created trusts Him with the change
of seasons and their provisions, but the very people He lovingly made
in His own image, seem to constantly doubt His care for them. Have
you factored God into your economic equation? Call upon Him and rest
in His care! God keeps His promises!
