_Matthew 22:37  
Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind._

Happy Heart Day! This is the day we usually focus on loving others.
When you love God with all your heart, soul, and mind, you won't need
a designated day to show love to others, it will happen every day.
Choose to show love to someone who is alone or might be overlooked!
