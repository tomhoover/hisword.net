_Psalm 37:25  
I have been young, and now am old; yet I have not seen the righteous
forsaken, nor his seed begging bread._

If you will put the Lord first in your finances and give God His
part, you will never, as long as you live, have to beg for bread.
This is a promise that you can take to the bank!! God is committed to
providing for every one of His children.
