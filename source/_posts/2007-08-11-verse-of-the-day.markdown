_Luke 15:6  
And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and
neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my
sheep which was lost._

The thought here is that the sheep owner feels exuberant joy to be
almost too much for himself to bear alone, and is positively relieved
by having others to share it with him. It's like you were sitting home
alone and you opened an envelope in the mail, and inside, you found a
check for a million dollars! You might run out and find someone,
anyone appropriate, to rejoice with you. This is the rejoicing in
heaven and in the heart of our God when a lost soul receives Christ.
Your salvation started a party in heaven!
