_Psalm 139:4  
For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest
it altogether._

Most people have no idea how powerful their words can be, but the
Lord knows. Would you "bless" someone with an encouraging word today?
Would you "thank" that person who everyone takes for granted? Would
you "hold that criticism," and just keep your mouth shut instead?
Would you "speak up" and hush the gossip? Would you "love" your God
with audible praise? Your words could change someone's life today!
