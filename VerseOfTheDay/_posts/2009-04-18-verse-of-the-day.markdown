title: April 18th - Partnership with God for a Victorious Life
---

_Isaiah 50:10  
Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of
his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? Let him
trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God._

Do you know anyone who is going through a dark time, where it seems
there is no "Light" in their life? Before the day is over God will
bring someone into your life who needs to know of the hope that only
a relationship with Jesus Christ can bring. Will your heart be
trusting God and be prepared to share His "Light"?
