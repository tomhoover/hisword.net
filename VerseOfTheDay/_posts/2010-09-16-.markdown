_II Corinthians 4:17  
For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us
a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory._

When you are going through a rough stretch of road, you can come to
think it is going to last forever! No one's afflictions are light when
you hurt! We are reminded in our verse that, in fact, all afflictions
are for a short time compared to the unlimited time the Christian
will spend with God in eternity. May God give you a fresh focus, and
may this renewed viewpoint "lighten" the burden and pain of your
afflictions.
