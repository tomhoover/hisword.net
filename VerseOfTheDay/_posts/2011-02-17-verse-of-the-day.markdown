_Galatians 5:16  
This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the
lust of the flesh._

C. S. Lewis said, "There is no neutral ground in the universe;
every square inch, every split second is claimed by God and
counterclaimed by Satan." In other words, there is a war being fought
in regards to your spiritual life! Claim today's verse that says, "if
you walk in the Spirit, you won't be overcome by the lusts of this
present world." It's great to know that a Christian can win the war
with God's help!
