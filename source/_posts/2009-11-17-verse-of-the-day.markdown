_Matthew 5:8  
Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God._

There is nothing that will bring you more happiness than keeping
your heart clean before God. If you find yourself struggling to be
happy, it could mean that you need to confess your sin. When you get
your windows washed, you can see God at work in your life.
