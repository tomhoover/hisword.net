_Ephesians 1:22-23  
22 And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the
head over all things to the church,  
23 Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all._

Your Partner in life, Jesus Christ, was thinking of you, and your
needs when He organized His church. He knew there would be times when
you would need a human voice and a human hug of encouragement. He
fills and uses individuals to affirm His Presence in the lives of
others. What an awesome Savior! He is your Partner in every part of
your life!
