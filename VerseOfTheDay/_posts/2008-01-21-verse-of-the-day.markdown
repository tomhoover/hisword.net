_Isaiah 40:28  
Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God,
the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither
is weary? there is no searching of his understanding._

Do you understand all of God's ways? When you argue with Him, you
are saying that you know more than He does. Purpose to grow in grace
and knowledge of His Word in 2008.
