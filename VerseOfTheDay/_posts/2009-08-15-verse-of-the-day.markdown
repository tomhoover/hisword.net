_Deuteronomy 31:6  
Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them;
for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not
fail thee, nor forsake thee._

Some people are afraid of change. They can't imagine giving more
time to serve God, or help others. They are afraid that they won't
get their work done. God says that if you will serve Him, He'll not
fail you nor forsake you. In other words, He will make everything
work out okay. Why not just make the needed changes in your life and
trust God to work out the details!
