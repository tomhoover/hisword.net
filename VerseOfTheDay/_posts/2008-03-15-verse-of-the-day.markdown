_Matthew 6:25  
Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye
shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye
shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than
raiment?_

What are you doing today? Where are you going? Take a minute to ask
God to help you prioritize your life.
