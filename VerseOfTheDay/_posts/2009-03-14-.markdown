title: March 14th - Partnership with God to Touch Lives
---

_Proverbs 11:30  
The fruit of righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls
is wise._

The fruit trees are starting to bud and blossom. It's just natural
for them to do this, because that is what God made them to do. If you
have given your heart to Jesus Christ, you are also made to bud and
blossom. When you share God's plan of salvation with a lost world,
you are being fruitful and wise.
