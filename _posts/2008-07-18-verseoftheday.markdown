title: July 18th - God&rsquo;s Place of Salvation
---

_Psalm 28:8  
The Lord is their strength, and He is the saving strength of His
annointed._

God not only is at work in the lives of all Christians, He is
interested in helping YOU individually. At some point during this
day, you will probably run out of energy. Pray and ask God to
strengthen and renew you. Then when you get that unexplained
&ldquo;lift&rdquo;, bow your head and thank Him, like David did.
