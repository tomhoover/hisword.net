title: September 28th - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Psalm 130:3-4  
3 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?  
4 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared._

What if the word "sinner" appeared on your forehead every time you
sinned? It could be quite embarrassing, for the word to appear when
you are in front of people. You might think a little harder before
you speak or act. You would also ask for your slate to be erased more
promptly. May you live your day with an awareness of sin and God's
forgiveness.
