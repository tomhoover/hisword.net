title: March 5th - Partnership with God to Touch Lives
---

_II Thessalonians 2:16-17  
Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which
hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good
hope through grace, Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every
good word and work._

/There is nothing you can do to make God love you more or less./
You are absolutely secure in His everlasting love after you give your
heart to Him. If you will take this thought with you today, it will
give you /boldness/ to share this truth with a needy world.
