_Hebrews 11:4  
By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain,
by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of
his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh._

A FAITH FULL example is something you can leave behind that will
live on after you die. Abel didn't live as long as the rest of His
family members, but he is the only one mentioned to have FAITH in
this chapter. This is just an example of the truth that "it's not how
long you live that counts," but "how you live that counts!" The
pleasures of this life are short. Make every day an investment in
eternity for yourself and those who come behind you.
