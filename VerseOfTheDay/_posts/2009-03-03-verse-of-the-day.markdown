title: March 3rd - Partnership with God to Touch Lives
---

_II Corinthians 5:20  
Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech
you by us: we pray you in Christ&rsquo;s stead, be ye reconciled to
God._

If you have Christ in your heart, you are representing Him! Your
mission, should you choose to embrace it today, is to just tell
someone how Jesus Christ has changed your life. Keep your eyes open.
God wants to use you to bless others, today!
