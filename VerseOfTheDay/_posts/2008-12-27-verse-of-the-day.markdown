_Psalm 34:10  
The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the
Lord, shall not want any good thing._

When the mother lion is trying to wean her cubs, she makes sure
that they leave her presence still hungry. If she fed them till they
were full, they would never leave home. God is not that way. He wants
to give us His best all the time. As your partner for life, He's also
promised that you will never want for any good thing.
