_Luke 9:62  
And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough,
and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God._

When you embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, you are saying that
from now on you are going to live your life with God. Sometimes we
forget that we must leave the former life behind, if we are going to
have a strong partnership with God. Loyalty to God is an everyday
commitment. Who will you represent today?
