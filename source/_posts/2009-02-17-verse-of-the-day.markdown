_Proverbs 16:32  
He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that
ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city._

You might not have a lot of physical muscles, but you can be
"strong," if you know how to keep your passions under control. The
strength needed to control anger, lust, or evil desires, comes from
your Partner, God. Before you go any farther, stop and ask Him to
strengthen your resolve to do and say the right today.
