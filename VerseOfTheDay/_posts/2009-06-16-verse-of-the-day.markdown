_Proverbs 29:25  
The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the
Lord shall be safe._

Is there really any completely safe place upon this earth? A right
relationship with the Lord is the best guarantee for safety, not a
location. Nothing and nobody can harm you when you are in God's
safety net, unless they come past Him first. This truth can make your
FAITH an even greater adventure, if you only BELIEVE!
