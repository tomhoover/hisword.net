_Psalm 31:7  
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercies: for thou hast considered
my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities._

It's Monday!! Smiles can come a little slower on Mondays. You may
need to stop and thank God for all your blessings. As you reflect on
all the hard times when God has been there for you, it will warm your
heart, and bring a smile to your face. This would be a great day to
SHARE the difference that God makes in your life, with someone
else.
