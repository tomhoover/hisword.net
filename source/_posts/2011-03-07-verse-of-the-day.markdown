_Hebrews 11:9  
By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange
country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with
him of the same promise._

There are three generations mentioned in our verse. What a
wonderful heritage of people who loved the Lord. These people weren't
perfect, as they occasionally got their eyes on the world, but they
came back and walked with God. Through FAITH they believed God's
promise that this world's best is nothing compared to an eternal
existence with Him. Things will be better one day, pilgrim! Just be
resolved to walk with God today!
