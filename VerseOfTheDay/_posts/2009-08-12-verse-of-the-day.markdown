_I Thessalonians 5:23-24  
And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your
whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming
of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is He that calleth you, who also
will do it._

To change, you must be ready to give up what you are for what you
can become. It will require a sacrifice on your part, but God will be
faithful to help you, if you will but call upon Him.
