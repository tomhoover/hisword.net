_John 17:17  
Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth._

God's WORD exposes our sin. It breaks sin's power to bind us. It
dispels spiritual darkness and illuminates our path. God's WORD
actively transforms us to be like Christ as we allow it to work in
our lives. Read God's WORDS today, and the truth will breathe FAITH
into your life!
