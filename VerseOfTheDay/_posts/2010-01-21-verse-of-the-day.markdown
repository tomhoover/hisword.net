_Romans 14:8  
For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we
die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the
Lord's._

Now that verse, takes the fear and dread out of dying, but what
does it do for living? It motivates us to live every day of our lives
serving our Lord. We must make every day count, because life is too
short not to show our EXTREME LOVE for our Lord. According to this
verse, the only way you lose, it by living for self instead of the
Savior!
