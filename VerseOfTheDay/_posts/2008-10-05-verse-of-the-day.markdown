_Nahum 1:7  
The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and He
knoweth them that trust in Him._

A strong partnership with God is built upon trust. When you trust
God, it will keep your focus on Him and not the troubles of this
life. It will give you the confidence to go the extra mile and make
yourself vulnerable for the sake of others. Celebrate a trustworthy
and faithful God today!
