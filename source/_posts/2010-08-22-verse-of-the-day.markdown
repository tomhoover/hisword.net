_Psalm 130:5  
I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope._

There are times in our lives when it seems our HOPES are never
going to come to pass. You might want to give up on HOPE. However,
HOPE in Christ is constant and it never abandons you. You have the
Word of God to build your HOPE upon. Don't despair, wait patiently on
the completion of your HOPE!
