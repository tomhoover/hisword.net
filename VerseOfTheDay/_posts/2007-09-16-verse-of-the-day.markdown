_Psalm 91:4  
He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt
thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler._

The imagery of being under wings is a powerful and poignant picture
of the safety and security that only comes by faith in God through
Jesus Christ. The picture reveals to us the paternal love of God for
His children in providing the safe harbor in any of life&rsquo;s
storms; and don't miss the truth part of this verse. Walking in Bible
truth from God acts as a fortress of protection from the destructive
effects of error and evil.
