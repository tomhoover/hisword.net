_Nahum 1:7  
The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he
knoweth them that trust in him._

Do you ever wonder how in the world you are going to get through
something? It can be like when you are putting the pieces of a puzzle
together, and some of the pieces don't seem to fit. Just remember that
God's view from up above gives a better picture of the whole puzzle.
The LORD is a good puzzle-solver! TRUST Him!
