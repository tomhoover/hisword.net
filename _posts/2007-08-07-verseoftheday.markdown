_Isaiah 53:6-7  
6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to
his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.  
7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his
mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep
before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth._

Our Lord Jesus, "meek and lowly," came to earth in His humanity,
the first time, not as the conquering King, but as the suffering
Servant. There is no greater example of humility than in the way that
Jesus meekly laid down His life for our lives, nor is there a greater
example of sacrifice. As the Apostle Paul stated, "For ye know the
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for
your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be
rich."
