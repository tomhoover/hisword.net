title: May 6th - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.

_I Timothy 2:8  
I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands,
without wrath and doubting._

Our first reaction to most problems is usually not prayer. Usually
we try to fix all the things we can without bothering God. God is
always listening for the sound of your voice calling out to Him. He
longs for your praise and communication. Whatever you have to do
today, do it with the Lord. Acknowledge Him and talk to Him about
everything. You will greatly enjoy His company, and you will be
better for the time spent with Him.
