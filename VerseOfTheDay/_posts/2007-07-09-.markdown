_Psalm 145:3  
Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is
unsearchable._

In our day, if you are searching for something, just "Google" it.
It is a wonderful thing that we trust in a God whose greatness is
"unsearchable." If we could completely comprehend all that there was
to know about God, then He wouldn't be God would He? Praise God we
serve a God who can be trusted without fear and with our future;
praise God we serve a God who desires an intimate relationship with
His children; and praise God we serve a God who can&rsquo;t be
"Googled" by man!
