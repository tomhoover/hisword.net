_Psalm 37:3  
Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and
verily thou shalt be fed._

It's great to start your week off with a mutual agreement with the
Lord. Spend some time in His Word this morning, and then ask Him to
help you make the best investment of your day. The all-knowing God
knows exactly what you need today. Trust Him.
