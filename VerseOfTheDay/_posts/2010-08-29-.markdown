title: August 29th - Extreme Love...hopes and believes the best.
---

_Psalm 119:81  
My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word._

Some people can only see a HOPELESS end, while others see an
endless HOPE. Which are you? No matter what your circumstances, there
is always HOPE, if it's placed in the Lord Jesus Christ. Ask the Lord
to help you encourage someone who is struggling to see HOPE. Your
words and actions, could make a difference in someone's life today!
