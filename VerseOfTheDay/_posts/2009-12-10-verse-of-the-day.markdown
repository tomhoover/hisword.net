title: December 10th - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_Song of Solomon 8:6  
Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for
love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals
thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame._

Someone said, "In jealousy there is more self-love than real love."
Oh that we would focus on the power and strength of God's love in our
lives instead of the things we don't have. The Bible tells us that
God's love is stronger than death, and it will breathe life into
every part of your life. Be determined to focus more on GOD today and
less upon yourself!
