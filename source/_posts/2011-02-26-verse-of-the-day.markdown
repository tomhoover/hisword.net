_Psalm 121:1  
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
help._

Some people think David wrote this verse in reflection of Mount
Moriah, the holy hill of God, where the ark of the covenant dwelt.
This holy hill was the place where God's presence was displayed. We
know that mountains, in themselves, have no power to give us
strength, but God's presence is still very powerful in the life of
the believer! Be encouraged in your FAITH, and keep your eyes upon
God today! He's FAITH FULL.
