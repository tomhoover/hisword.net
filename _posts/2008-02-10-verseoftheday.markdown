title: February 10th - God's Place of Presence
---

_Hebrews 13:5  
Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with
such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee,
nor forsake thee._

A carnal heart says, "I want more possessions." A spiritual heart
says, "I&rsquo;m content with God and what I have." This is your
challenge for today: Before every decision or action, discern if
contentment would change that decision or action. This will bring an
awareness of God's presence in your life today.
