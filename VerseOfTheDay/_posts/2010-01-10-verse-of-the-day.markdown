title: January 10th - Extreme Love...Is not proud or self-focused
---

_Psalm 101:5  
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I cut off: him that
hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer._

"We are all, but flesh!" The very things that we can get upset with
others about, are in our own lives, yet we never seem to see them.
Before you are tempted to complain about a neighbor, or fellow
Christian, be mindful that God hears what you say, and He knows where
you are guilty of similar things. None of us should have a proud heart
and criticize others, because on our best days, we are ALL sinners.
Hopefully you are a sinner saved by grace. Don't forget to show that
same grace to those in your life.
