title: February 4th - Partnership with God in Loving Relationships
---

_James 2:8  
If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well._

It is God's will that we should love other people as much or more
than we do ourselves. Most of us, think way too much about ourselves,
and very little about others. Ask God to help you put "self" aside
today, and look to the needs of others, so that God's love can be
seen in you.
