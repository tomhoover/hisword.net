_Psalm 86:7  
In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt
answer me._

Here we have a pious resolve backed by a judicious reason. Our
experience confirms us in the belief that Jesus Christ, the living
God, really does aid those who call upon him, and therefore we pray
and mean to pray because we really, indeed, find it to be a practical
and effectual means of obtaining help from God in the hour of need.
