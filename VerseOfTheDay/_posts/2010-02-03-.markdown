title: February 3rd - Extreme Love...is gracious, not rude.
---

_Romans 13:10  
Love worketh no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the
fulfilling of the law._

You are given a challenge to "love" the people God puts before you
today. If you are loving people, you will be helping them, not
scheming to bring them down. If you are loving people, you will be
looking for an opportunity to give, not take. If you are loving
people, you might need to have your eyes on Jesus, not injustice. If
you are loving people you will have to make a personal sacrifice, in
order to show His EXTREME LOVE!
