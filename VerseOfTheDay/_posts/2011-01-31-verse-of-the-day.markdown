_Proverbs 1:7  
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools
despise wisdom and instruction._

Fear of the Lord is referred to nearly thirty times in the book of
Proverbs. To fear God is to respect God and hate evil. It's unusual,
but this fear actually brings you safety. The Christian who
approaches God reverently and humbly, will come to know God&rsquo;s
wisdom. FAITH is still the operative word! FAITH in God and His BOOK
will give you the best possible life! FAITH-BOOK!
