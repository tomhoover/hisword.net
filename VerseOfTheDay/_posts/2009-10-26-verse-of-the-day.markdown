title: October 26th - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_II Peter 3:9  
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any
should perish, but that all should come to repentance._

When you think about "Extreme LOVE and patience," one of the
greatest examples is shown in regard to God's patience with mankind.
Just think about the thousands of earthly years God has given men
upon this earth an opportunity to repent and trust in Him. In light
of His patience, do you think you could present His gospel to that
"stubborn heart" one more time?
