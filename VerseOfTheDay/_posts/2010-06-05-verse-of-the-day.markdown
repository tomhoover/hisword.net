_John 8:31-32  
Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue
in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the
truth, and the truth shall make you free._

You may think you are free because you live in America and are
guaranteed certain freedoms, but when God talks about freedom, He's
concerned about your soul. In order to experience the TRUTH that can
set you free, you must understand from God's Word that you are a
sinner. When you give your heart to Jesus, those things that would
bind you and pull you down into darkness, are given notice. Fear,
rejection, worry, and uncertainties, no longer have power over your
life. TRUTH continues to free and change thought patterns and life
styles throughout the lives of the believers who continue in His
Word. Does sin have a hold on you?
