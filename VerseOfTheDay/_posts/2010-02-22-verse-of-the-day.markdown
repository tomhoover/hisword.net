title: February 22nd - Extreme Love...is gracious, not rude.

_I Peter 5:5-6  
Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of
you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God
resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble
yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt
you in due time: Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for
you._

Respect for those older than you is a Biblical principle. When you
show respect in your speech and actions for those who are older than
you, or for those who are leaders over you, it is evident that you
have a humble spirit. God gives a special grace to those who will
humble themselves before others. Need some extra grace and a blessing
today? Humbly submit yourself to God and others.
