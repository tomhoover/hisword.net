title: March 1st - Extreme Love...is giving.
---

_I Corinthians 13:5b  
...seeketh not her own..._

We are living at a time when people live with an attitude of
pleasing themselves, instead of others. If you are to experience the
power of "Extreme Love" in your life, you will have to be different
and think differently. Instead of thinking, "How will this help me?"
the proper concept would be "How can I help others?" God has shown us
that genuine love, doesn't think of self first, but is willing to give
to others, suffering personal loss, so that others might prosper. Ask
God to help you focus on "giving" instead of "getting," today!
