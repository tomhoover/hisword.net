_Isaiah 7:14  
Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin
shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel._

Thank you for keeping your promises, Lord! You said you would give
us a sign and that sign was the "miraculous supernatural birth" of
your Son, Jesus Christ. Lord, You gave us a Savior so that there
could be a miraculous second birth in the souls of all who will
believe. Our souls explode in praise, as we think upon this extreme
gift of Your love! There are no earthly expressions loud enough or
extravagant enough to voice our heart's praise to You. &ndash; With
full hearts, Your children, bow before You.
