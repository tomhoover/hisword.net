title: May 13th - Partnership with God in Attitude and Mind-Set
---

_Ephesians 6:7  
With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men._

Sometimes you can get tired of always being the person who has to
give. You may have someone in your life who is a taker, not a giver.
You may need to take the "attitude challenge." When you find yourself
needing to "wash someone else's feet," today, envision the warmth and
love of your Savior, saying, "Well done, thou good and faithful
servant!" When you have the proper attitude, you see God, not
injustice.
