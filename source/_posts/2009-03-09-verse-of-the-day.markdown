_Romans 10:9-10  
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou
shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness;
and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation._

If you have asked Jesus Christ to come into your heart, you are
going to want to confess Him before men. Don't let this be just
another day on planet earth. May your thankful heart motivate you to
"confess" His name before a watching a world.
