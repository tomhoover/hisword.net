title: April 27th - Extreme Love...works at overcoming anger.
---

_Proverbs 21:24  
Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath._

Pride is one of the greatest motivators of anger. In this day and
age, we think we deserve to be treated right. No one should
contradict us or slight us. Pride puts people in their place and
responds condescendingly to others. Humility embraces the lifestyle
of a servant and defers to God. May you embrace the example of our
Savior, and represent your LORD well today!
