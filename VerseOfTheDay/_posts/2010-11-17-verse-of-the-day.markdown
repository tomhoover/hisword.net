_I Timothy 6:11  
But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after
righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness._

In the previous verses, we are admonished not to put our trust in
the riches of this world. You may have to work to make a living, but
working is not your reason for living. As you go about your work
today, reflect upon God's focus words for the day: righteousness,
godliness, faith, love, patience, and meekness. When you work to
incorporate these things in your life, your work will become a means
of serving God, not laying up riches.
