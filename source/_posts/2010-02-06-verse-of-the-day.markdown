_Psalm 39:1  
I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue:
I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me._

William Shakespeare said, "Words without thoughts, never to heaven
go." In other words, take time to think about what you say, before
you say it. When someone is rude to you, often the natural response
is to give it back to them, before you even think. If you have
prepared your heart, asking for God's help, you will be more likely
to keep your mouth shut.
