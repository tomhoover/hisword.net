_I Peter 2:6-7  
6 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in
Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on
him shall not be confounded.  
7 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them
which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the
same is made the head of the corner._

Like a magnet and its two poles, the Gospel of Jesus Christ invokes
opposite reactions, but neither effects the ultimate position of
Christ as the Chief Cornerstone. To the believer, He is the Rock of
Refuge, the Rock of your salvation; but to the unbeliever, He is also
a Rock, a Rock of offense and a stumbling stone. Jesus as the Chief
Cornerstone is immoveable, it is man whose eternal foundation is laid
depending on how he approaches the Stone.
