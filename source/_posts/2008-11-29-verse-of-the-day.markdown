_Nehemiah 1:6a  
Let Thine ear now be attentive, and Thine eyes open, that Thou
mayest hear the prayer of Thy servant, which I pray before Thee
now._

A servant's prayer captures the ear and eyes of God, unlike any
other prayer. Phillips Brooks defines it best: /"Do not pray for easy
lives. Pray to be stronger men. Do not pray for tasks equal to your
powers, pray for power equal to your task."/ Do you pray with a
servant's heart?
