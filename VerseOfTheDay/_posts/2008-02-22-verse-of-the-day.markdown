_Psalm 23:4  
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort
me._

In the most difficult times of your life, you are not alone. When
Jesus was facing a difficult time, He would spend time with the
Father, who comforted Him. God is still comforting the lambs who come
to Him, and He will draw you close with His touch.
