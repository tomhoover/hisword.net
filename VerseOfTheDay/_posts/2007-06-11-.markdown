_Psalm 32:8  
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go:
I will guide thee with mine eye._

Here the Lord is the speaker, and gives the Psalmist an answer to
his prayer. Our Savior is our instructor. The Lord himself deigns to
teach his children to walk in the way of integrity, His Holy Word,
the leadership of the Holy Spirit through one of the Lord's
Biblically sound churches, and prayer are the directors of the
believer's daily life.
