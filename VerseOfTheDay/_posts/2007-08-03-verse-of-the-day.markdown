_John 10:2  
But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep._

This verse is both devotional and theological, but here, we will
highlight the devotional. At night, all the sheep in Palestine were
herded into a sheepfold for protection. There was only one door, and
it was only about as wide as a shepherd was long. The shepherd
himself would sleep in that door, in effect becoming the door! No
sheep could exit and no prey could enter! Jesus is that door, and in
fact says so later in John 10: "I am the door: by me if any man enter
in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture."
John 10:9
