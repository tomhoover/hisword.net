title: June 30th - God&rsquo;s Place of Peace
---

_Revelation 1:4b  
...Grace be unto you, and peace, from Him which is, and which was,
and which is to come..._

The peace of heart that Jesus gives us today is great, but peace
has an even greater future. Someday Jesus Christ will reign upon this
earth and there will be absolute peace, with the absence of all sin.
That ought to put a smile on your face and a twinkle in your eye. Get
ready. He&rsquo;s coming!
