_Psalm 31:23  
O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth the
faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer._

What motivates you to do what you do for God? If you have any
motive, other than a heart of true love for God, then you are missing
out. Our verse says you will either burn out or become obsessed with
selfish accomplishments. If your motive for serving God is genuine
love for Him, you will remain faithful.
