_Hebrews 6:19  
Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast,
and which entereth into that within the veil._

Someone said, "The average person can live about forty days without
food, about three days without water, about eight minutes without air,
but there is no real living without HOPE." If you have Christ in your
heart, you are anchored in HOPE! Your HOPE is based upon Jesus
Christ, not in the temporal things of this world.
