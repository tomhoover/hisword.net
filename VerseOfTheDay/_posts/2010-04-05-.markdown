title: April 5th - Extreme Love...works at overcoming anger.
---

_Proverbs 15:1  
A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up
anger._

We live in such a "loud" world. That's why a "soft" word is so very
noticeable. It's Monday, and you can just count on there being someone
in your life, who is starting the week off tired and irritable.
Purpose to have the "soft" word for those "loud" voices in your life
your today! God will help you, if you but ask.
