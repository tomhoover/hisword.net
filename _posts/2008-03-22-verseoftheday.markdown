title: March 22nd - God&rsquo;s Place of Promise
---

_I Peter 1:3  
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively
hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead._

He&rsquo;s Alive! You don&rsquo;t have to wait till Easter to
celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. In the busyness of your
day and your preparations for tomorrow, don&rsquo;t forget it&rsquo;s
about Jesus, not you!
