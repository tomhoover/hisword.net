_II Corinthians 13:4  
For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the
power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him
by the power of God toward you._

Go over your 2008 resolutions again today. Declare your weakness
before God, and ask for His strength to accomplish them.
