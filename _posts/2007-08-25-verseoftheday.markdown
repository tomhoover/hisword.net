_Acts 11:23  
Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and
exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto
the Lord._

In context, this is faithful Barnabas who, although he didn't
understand what God was doing, recognized that it was God doing it,
in His abundant grace, and was glad because God, who did understand
what He was doing, did it. Get it? God will always work within the
confines of His written Word, but don't put God in a box of your own
making. He is an infinite God, who will work His will for man in
infinite ways. Learn to recognize that God usually works in ways that
we didn&rsquo;t see coming, and be glad that He is working.
