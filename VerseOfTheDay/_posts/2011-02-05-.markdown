_Ephesians 6:14  
Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having
on the breastplate of righteousness._

This verse expresses a posture that is necessary if you are to have
a fulfilling Christian life. You must stand! There is no sitting down
or giving up. Standing in truth is a picture of a strong FAITH that
is determined to serve God no matter if you are the only one left
standing! Are you standing?
