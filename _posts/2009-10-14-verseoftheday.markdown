title: October 14th - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_James 1:4  
But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and
entire, wanting nothing._

When you have a patient spirit, you will find yourself making fewer
demands and being more satisfied with what you have. This present
world is constantly telling you that you need more possessions to be
happy. The opposite is true, when you are content with what you have,
patience has done a work in your heart. Let patience do its work on
your heart today. Lay up treasures in heaven, not on earth.
