_Psalm 117:1-2  
O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people. For
his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD
endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD._

As the time of Thanksgiving is approaching, we are reminded to
count our blessings. Have you ever thought about all the small acts
of kindness that the Lord gives you every day? A time to rest your
body... food to strengthen you... relationships to encourage and
affirm you... a purpose for your life... forgiveness of sin... all
your needs are met in the EXTREME LOVE of God!
You must praise God for His merciful kindness, if you don't the
rocks will cry out!
