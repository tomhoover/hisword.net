_Philippians 1:6  
Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good
work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:_

Are you sure? Do you really believe that God is committed to
helping you with your goals? God is totally committed to you, but you
must exercise your will to believe this and daily commit your concerns
to Him. God wants you to be successful, as this brings honor and glory
to Him.
