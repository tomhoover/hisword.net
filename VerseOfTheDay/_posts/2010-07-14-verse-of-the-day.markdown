_Isaiah 57:15  
For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity,
whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also
that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the
humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones._

Are you weary? The God of eternity possesses all power and
strength, and He longs to revive your heart today! He wants you to
dwell with Him in high and holy places. Humble yourself before Him,
and you will see things differently. You will only have "eyes" for
Him, as you leave the cares of this world behind.
