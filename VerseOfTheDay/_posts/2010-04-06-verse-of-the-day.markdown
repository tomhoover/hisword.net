_Colossians 3:8  
But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,
filthy communication out of your mouth._

Our verse is one of several verses where Paul addresses behavior
that is unbecoming to a Christian. The whole verse has to do with
different ways your tongue can get you in trouble. It's no accident
that he starts with anger. Anger is one of the most destructive ways
to ruin your testimony, and also ruin the lives of others. Listen to
God's Word today. Instead of getting angry or upset with others,
purpose to show the same grace to others that God has shown to you.
