_Psalm 34:19  
Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth
him out of them all._

Just in case you think you are the only one in the midst of a fiery
furnace, re-read our verse. All those who are righteous (those who
have asked Christ into their heart), will have trials. Not just one
trial, but many! Oh no, Christians are going to have many trials!
Should that worry the Christian? No, because the rest of the verse
says, these afflictions have an expiration date. The Lord promises to
be with you and to deliver you in the way He knows is best for you.
You must focus on the promise that He will deliver you out of ALL
your afflictions!
