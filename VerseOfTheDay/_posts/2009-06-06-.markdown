title: June 6th - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith
---

_Psalm 23:3-4  
3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
for his name's sake.  
4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they
comfort me._

R. Tagore said, "Faith is a bird that feels dawn breaking and sings
while it is still dark." That's a picture of the Christian&rsquo;s
life upon this earth. We can sing every day, in the midst of the
darkness upon this earth, knowing that one day the dawn will break
and the "Light" of the world will take us to be with Him. Until that
day we all must sing! Let His song of salvation be upon your lips
today!
