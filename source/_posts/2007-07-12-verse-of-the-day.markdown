_Proverbs 25:13  
As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his
masters._

I'm sitting here at church camp where it has been raining all week.
The great news is that instead of 98 degrees, it is 72 degrees at
1:00pm!! As snow, that in those hot countries used to be kept in
vessels, in places underground, to cool their drink with in
summertime; just as ice is kept with us; so is the blessed peace that
comes to the message sender who learns that his important message had
been delivered. Thus is God pleased when we are faithful to share His
truth as He was with Jesus His Son who faithfully delivered His truth
to the world.
