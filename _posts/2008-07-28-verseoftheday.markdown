title: July 28th - God&rsquo;s Place of Salvation
---

_II Peter 3:9  
The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count
slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any
should perish, but that all should come to repentance._

Okay, it&rsquo;s Monday! You may need to reflect upon some of
God&rsquo;s promises to keep yourself focused today. The promise of
salvation and being kept in His care is something that will make your
day worth living. Why not share this with someone who doesn&rsquo;t
know Him?
