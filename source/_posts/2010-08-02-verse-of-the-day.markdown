_Psalm 33:18  
Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them
that hope in his mercy._

When you have HOPE, it means you are figuring God into your life.
If you could just remember that no matter how dark or bad your
situation looks, there is always mercy and HOPE, when you are
connected through faith and trust in Jesus Christ. God's eyes are
upon you! Believe it, and live like it today! Go in the confidence of
a HOPE based upon a living, loving GOD!
