_Ephesians 4:15  
But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things,
which is the head, even Christ._

Our verse is telling us that when you can quietly and lovingly tell
someone the TRUTH, and they will accept it, you are reaching a new
level of maturity in Jesus Christ. The way you speak TRUTH makes all
the difference. May the words you speak today reflect the passionate
inclusive love of Christ, without compromising the TRUTH found in His
Word.
