_Zechariah 9:12a  
Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope._

Do you ever feel like you are involved in a hopeless situation? If
that's the way you feel, you have a become a prisoner of
discouragement. On the other hand if you always include hope and turn
it over to the "Strong One," our Lord, you will be captured by hope.
Hope is God's natural adrenaline that is released in the lives of
Christians when they believe His faithful promises! Put hope on your
face, it's liberating!
