_Proverbs 13:9  
The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked
shall be put out._

The things you see from the reflection of a lamp are different from
the things the LIGHT of God reveals. Lamps only reveal parts of the
whole object. The LIGHT of God's Word reveals an absolute whole truth
that brings joy to the BELIEVER and judgment for the wicked. Turn on
the LIGHT of God's Word. It will brighten your day!
