_Psalm 139:17  
How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the
sum of them!_

It is a joy worth worlds that the Lord should think upon us who are
so poor and needy, it is a joy which fills our whole nature to think
upon God; returning love for love, thought for thought, after our
poor fashion. "How great is the sum of them!" When we remember that
God thought upon us from old eternity, continues to think upon us
every moment, and will think of us when time shall be no more, we may
well exclaim, "How great is the sum!" (The Treasury of David)
