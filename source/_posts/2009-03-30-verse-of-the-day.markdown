_Galatians 3:26  
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus._

Make no mistake! If you have not put your faith and trust in Jesus
Christ, and Him alone, to forgive your sins, you are not one of His
children. There are many religions, but there is only one way, and
that is through Jesus Christ, God's Son. God's Word is clear. Share
it!
