title: April 26th- God&rsquo;s Place of Care
---

_Psalm 10:11  
He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face;
he will never see it._

Most of the time we live our lives foolishly thinking that if
others don&rsquo;t see us do something wrong, then we are okay. The
truth is, the One who matters the most, sees everything we do and
say. God cares, do right!
