_Matthew 25:25  
And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth, lo,
there thou hast that is thine._

God has blessed you with some wonderful gifts, one of which is
salvation through His Son, Jesus Christ. Don't be afraid to share
this priceless gift with others. It could really "light" up and
change someone's Christmas!
