title: January 3rd - God's Place of Power
---

_Romans 13:1  
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no
power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God._

When you woke up this morning, did you think about the
accessibility of God's power in your life? This could be the
difference between success and failure today. Those who are dependent
upon God are more successful.
