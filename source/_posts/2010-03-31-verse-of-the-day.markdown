_Romans 5:8  
But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
sinners, Christ died for us._

This month is almost gone, but God's love remains as vibrant and
powerful as ever. Will you share this verse with someone who doesn't
know Jesus today? There are still a lot of sinners out there who need
to know that God loves them right where they are, and that Christ died
for their sins. Extreme love demands an action on your part!
