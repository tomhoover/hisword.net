_Romans 5:8  
But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
sinners, Christ died for us._

j "I'm dreaming of a white Christmas...." l The Christian version
of this is, I'm praying for someone who needs a white Christmas. Will
you stop and pray for someone who needs their sins cleansed white as
snow?
