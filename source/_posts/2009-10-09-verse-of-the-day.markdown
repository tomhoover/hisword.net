_Hebrews 10:36  
For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of
God, ye might receive the promise._

Christians can be like spoiled little children sometimes when they
don't get what they think they deserve from God. Some will even turn
their back on God when their wants are not met. It is sobering to
think that sometimes the conditions for us receiving our requests,
hinges upon our patience and trust in God's will and timing. Are you
one of those Christians who needs to have more patience?
