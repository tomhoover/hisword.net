_II Corinthians 12:8-9  
8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart
from me.  
9 And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my
strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I
rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest
upon me._

There will be times when you think God doesn't hear your prayer,
but it is during these times that He is doing His greatest work
&ndash; working on your attitude! Smile, focusing on God's grace can
change your day!
