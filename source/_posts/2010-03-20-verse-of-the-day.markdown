_II Corinthians 10:17  
But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord._

Extreme Love doesn't have to have personal recognition. Extreme
Love understands that anything good in anyone is a tribute to God,
not them. Praise the Lord for life, health, food, clothing,
protection, and most of all, His Extreme Love for you. Glory in the
Lord! It's all about Him!
