title: July 16th - Partnership with God in Sacrifice
---

_James 1:27  
Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To
visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep
himself unspotted from the world._

Orphans and widows hold a special place in God's heart, and they
should be special to you as well. As the Lord lays someone on your
heart today, do something to encourage them. You might have to
re-arrange your day, but the sacrifice, might make a huge difference
in a widow's life.
