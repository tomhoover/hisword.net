_Psalm 18:3  
I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I
be saved from mine enemies._

There you go! There's the answer for every trying situation in your
life! CALL UPON THE LORD! Have you been carrying those heavy burdens
around and forgotten that your LORD loves and cares for you? PRAISE
HIM! He treats you much better than you treat Him! He wants to help
you today! Call upon Him!
