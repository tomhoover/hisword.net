_Jeremiah 23:29  
Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer
that breaketh the rock in pieces?_

WOW! God is trying to give you a mental picture of just how
powerful His WORDS are in your life! If you have been a Christian for
a while, you can forget just how important it is for you to know and
keep God's WORDS in your heart! If you find that your FAITH isn't
very strong today, it could be that your heart isn't on fire for the
Lord, like it should be. Stop and ask God to ignite your FAITH
through the promises in His WORD.
