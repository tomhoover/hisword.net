_Psalm 100:3  
Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and
not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture._

This is part of the "make a joyful noise unto the Lord" Psalm/song
that we who don't sing so well often refer to. The Lord, who is still
and always on the throne, made you who you are and has placed you in
His pasture where it has pleased Him for His purpose which only you
can fill. It is not the same pasture, the same church, without you.
This is why God places each obedient believer into a church body, to
utilize their gifts and talents for His glory.
