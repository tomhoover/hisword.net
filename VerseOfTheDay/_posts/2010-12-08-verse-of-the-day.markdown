_Matthew 5:15  
Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a
candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house._

Are you one of those people who has candles in your house that you
have never burned? The kind that are just a decoration. Candles are
made to burn. It is only when you light them, that their fragrance
and beauty can be released. The same is true in your Christian life.
When you share the LIGHT of Jesus Christ with others, you have
released His essence. LIGHT your candle today, so others can see
Jesus!
