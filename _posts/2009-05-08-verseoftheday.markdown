_Psalm 63:3  
Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise
thee._

If you are a believer, there is a day coming when you going to live
for eternity in a perfect world. The question that must be asked is,
"What's a few short days of trouble on this earth?" Why not
acknowledge and praise God's lovingkindness today, while you can?
Everyone will praise God in heaven, but not everyone will praise God
on earth. /"If you don&rsquo;t think every day is a good day, just
try missing one."/ -Cavett Robert
