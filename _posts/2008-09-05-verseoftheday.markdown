title: September 5th - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Ephesians 4:32  
And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
even as God for Christ&rsquo;s sake hath forgiven you._

Sometime during this day, you will have a situation where you will
have to make a choice to either be "offended" or to "forgive". When
the situation arises, be tender-hearted and think about the way God
forgives you. Give the gift of "forgiveness" to all who cross your
path today.
