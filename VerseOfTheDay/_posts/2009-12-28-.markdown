title: December 28th - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_Philippians 4:4  
Rejoice in the Lord always: and again I say, Rejoice._

It's a command! REJOICE! Rain or shine... Good day or bad day...
All day... Every day! Because of God's Extreme Love for you, you have
a reason to rejoice! You may put away the Christmas ornaments, but
leave Jesus and JOY on display in your life! REJOICE! It's a
command!
