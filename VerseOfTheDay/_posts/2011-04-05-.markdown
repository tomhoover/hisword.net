_Psalm 49:15  
But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he
shall receive me. Selah._

Most scholars believe the word "Selah" means to "pause and praise."
The book of Psalms was used as a hymn book for the Israelites. This
meant they were instructed to stop or pause their singing. Then they
were to think about what they were saying, and out of an overflowing
heart, praise God! That's good advice for us! Would you pause,
re-read the above verse, and just praise GOD for a few moments? Is
there anything better than knowing you and your future are secure in
God? That should LIFT your heart and put a smile on your face!
