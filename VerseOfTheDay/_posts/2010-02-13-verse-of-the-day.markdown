title: February 13th - Extreme Love...is gracious, not rude.
---

_I John 4:11  
Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another._

/IF?/ The case has been presented that God loved you so much that
He gave His Son to die for the world. God set forth the pattern of
giving to all mankind, and if you accepted, received His love, you
are His child. /IF/ you are a recipient of His love, you are
admonished to apply the same pattern to your life. You are to be
giving love to all mankind, not picking and choosing those who are
easy to love. Think of someone in your life who is hard to love. Give
them a valentine from God and you!
