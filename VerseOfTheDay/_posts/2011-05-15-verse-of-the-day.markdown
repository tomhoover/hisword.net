_Isaiah 40:31  
But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they
shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be
weary; and they shall walk, and not faint._

Nobody likes to wait, unless you are putting off going to the
dentist! We don't like pain and suffering. We don't like the unknowns
in our life. We don't like anything that makes us wait! This waiting
stuff is hard! Why does God make us wait? Waiting makes and breaks
His children! God wants to strengthen His relationship with those who
wait on Him! Don't be discouraged, God promises to walk with you
during your wait! FAITH will carry you through!
