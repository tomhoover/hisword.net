_Ephesians 3:20-21  
20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,  
21 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all
ages, world without end. Amen._

As our Partner, God tells us that He does His greatest work through
Christians in local churches. That is such a touching and personal
thought! God will give you the power to do things for Him, that you
would never have imagined possible, when you work through His church.
You can accomplish twice as much working with others. Pray big!
