_Hebrews 2:18  
For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to
succour them that are tempted._

Our Lord Jesus, in His humanity, endured and emerged victorious
over more temptations to sin than we could begin to imagine, because
all the devil had to do was to get Him to sin once, and He could not
be our Savior! Jesus knows what we face in the flesh, and He is not
only able but desirous to help us to live as He wants us to live for
Him. He has been there, and He will be there for you.
