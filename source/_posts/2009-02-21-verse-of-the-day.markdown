_Proverbs 31:26  
She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of
kindness._

A wise person once said, "Words of kindness have changed more
people's lives than all of man's many inventions." Pray and ask God
to help you think about what you say today...that your words of
kindness might help change someone's life.
