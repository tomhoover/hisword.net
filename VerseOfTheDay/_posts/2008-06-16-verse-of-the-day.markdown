_I Corinthians 14:33  
For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all
churches of the saints._

Did you enjoy church yesterday? In wanting the very best for your
life, God gave you His church, a place where you can learn more about
Him and encourage one another. Church should be a place of peace for
every troubled heart. It also builds you up to face the reality of a
Monday!
