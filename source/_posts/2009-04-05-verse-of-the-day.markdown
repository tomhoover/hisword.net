_I John 5:4  
For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the
victory that overcometh the world, even our faith._

If you are a believer, you are not exempt from the problems and
trials of this world. You are promised help, though. The victory over
every trial in your life, comes when you put your FAITH in God. As an
overcomer, He alone can strengthen and equip you to rise above your
circumstances. Stop doing things your way, call upon God and put your
FAITH in Him!
