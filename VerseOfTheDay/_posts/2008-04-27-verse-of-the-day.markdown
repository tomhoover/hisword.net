title: April 27th- God&rsquo;s Place of Care
---

_Isaiah 40:11  
He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs
with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead
those that are with young._

The under Shepherd, your pastor, cares for all those in his flock.
He feeds the grown sheep and the tender lambs. He could probably use
some help with those young lambs. Encourage someone in your flock
today!
