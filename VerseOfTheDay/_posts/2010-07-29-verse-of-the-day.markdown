_Proverbs 27:17  
Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his
friend._

There ought to be a verse in Proverbs that says, "Getteth thou over
it!" or "Letteth it go!" We are all in need of relationships that make
us sharp, not dull; better, not bitter! Do you have a friend who will
be honest with you at all times and tell you things you don't exactly
want to hear? We all need these iron to iron relationships in our
lives, even if it causes a few sparks from time to time. In a loving
way, resolve to be a better friend today!
