_John 15:13  
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for
his friends._

If you are going to be a friend to people, you must be willing to
make a sacrifice. Friendships are about giving to others instead of
acquiring possessions for yourself. Sometimes friendship is going
totally out of your way to help a friend in need. Jesus Christ
demonstrated His love through sacrifice and you are called to do the
same.
