_I Thessalonians 2:19  
For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye
in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?_

What are you looking forward to doing today? Wouldn't it be
wonderful if the Lord came back today? Rejoice in the Lord! We live
with the sure hope of His "anytime" return.
