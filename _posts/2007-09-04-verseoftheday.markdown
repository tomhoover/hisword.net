_Psalm 107:8-9  
8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men!  
9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul
with goodness._

What more could a human soul (spiritual) and stomach (physical)
want but to be completely satisfied and filled. The joy and power of
a believer's life is to surrender to the Greater King (Luke 14:31-33)
who knows how to satisfy and fill the hungry soul (Matt. 5:6); but
note that according to Psalm 107:9, you must be "longing" and
"hungry" to be satisfied and filled!
