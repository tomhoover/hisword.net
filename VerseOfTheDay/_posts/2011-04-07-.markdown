_Romans 9:17  
For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose
have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that
my name might be declared throughout all the earth._

The Red Sea deliverance was one that God doesn't want the world to
soon forget, as our verse reminds us. This is just one of God's
mighty acts upon this earth to display His POWER in lives of His
people. How quickly we can forget God's deliverance in our lives. Can
you remember a time when God walked you through some high waters?
Focus on God's POWER today!
"Write today's worries in the sand. Chisel yesterday's victories in
