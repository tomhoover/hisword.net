_Philippians 2:6-7  
6 Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal
with God:  
7 But made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a
servant, and was made in the likeness of men._

There is a lot of injustice in this world and we can be quick to
express our disapproval when someone doesn't treat us right. Jesus
never had such an attitude. He gladly became a servant, so you could
see and experience God's love in human form! Will this same "servant
love" show up in you today?
