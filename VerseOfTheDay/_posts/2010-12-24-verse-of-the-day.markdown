title: December 24th - FaithLight...lighting your world through Faith in
---

_Luke 2:13-14  
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly
host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace, good will toward men._

This will be a busy day for most. If you aren't careful, your peace
and good will to others might be misplaced. If you keep your eyes on
Jesus, your joy will remain constant and you will be praising the
Savior, alongside the heavenly host. Jesus is the reason for the
season, and the gift that keeps on giving!
