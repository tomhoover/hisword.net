title: July 9th - Partnership with God in Sacrifice
---

_Hebrews 13:15  
By Him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to His
name._

You can substitute the word "gift" for the word "sacrifice" in our
verse. With that in mind, you are admonished to give God a gift
today! It's exciting to think that you could actually give God
something in light of how much He's given you! What does He want?
Lips that thank Him and praise Him continually! You can do that! Take
a minute and praise Him for ten blessings in your life.
