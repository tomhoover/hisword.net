_John 20:29  
Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast
believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
believed._

Jesus is so good to affirm our FAITH, but He tells us in our verse
that we are blessed when we believe even though our FAITH is not
seemingly affirmed outwardly. As Christians today, we are many years
removed from the time when Jesus walked upon this earth. We have not
actually seen Jesus Christ with our physical eyes, but the spiritual
eye gives vision and affirms His presence and salvation in our
hearts. Jesus blesses those who believe in 2010! One day soon we will
all see Him!
