_John 1:4  
In him was life; and the life was the light of men._

Have you ever met someone for the first time, and just knew by
their countenance that they were a Christian? Sometimes they speak
FAITH. Sometimes they have a warm smile or a twinkle in their eye.
Sometimes they let you "cut" in line at the store. Sometimes they
just overlook your mistakes and failures, without judging and
condemning you. How will others see God's "LIGHT" in you today?
