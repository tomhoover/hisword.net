_Psalm 107:8-9  
8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men!  
9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul
with goodness._

Have you been thinking about all the good food that goes with this
time of the year? Think about the spiritual food God gives that
satisfies and keeps your soul full. Share God's goodness with someone
at your next meal.
