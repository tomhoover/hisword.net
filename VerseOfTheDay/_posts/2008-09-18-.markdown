title: September 18th - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Romans 4:7-8  
7 Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose
sins are covered.  
8 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin._

Are you happy today? If your sins are confessed and forgiven, you
genuinely have something to be happy about! Your life is blessed with
God's greatest gift to you, in the person of Jesus Christ. Happiness
isn't conditional to your circumstances, it is based on your
forgiveness. YOU CAN BE HAPPY!
