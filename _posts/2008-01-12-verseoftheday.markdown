title: January 12th - God's Place of Power
---

_Hebrews 1:10  
And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the
earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands._

Someday you will see the nail-pierced hands that lovingly created
you. Although God is invisible now, His power fills the earth, and
the lives of those who put their trust in Him. Show His power through
a good attitude today, no matter your circumstances!
