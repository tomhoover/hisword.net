title: June 20th - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith
---

_Lamentations 3:25  
The Lord is good unto them that wait for Him, to the soul that
seeketh Him._

Faith is a great adventure, because you never know where God will
take you when you absolutely abandon yourself to His plan for your
life. You could be missing out on some great stuff in your life by
hanging onto your security. God wants to give you His best if you
will only have FAITH and trust Him!
