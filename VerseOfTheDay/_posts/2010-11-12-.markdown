_Psalm 127:1  
Except the LORD build the house, they labor in vain that build it:
except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain._

Many second generation Christians can live their lives with a FAITH
more in themselves than in God. They are living in the blessings of
their parents FAITH. Every one of us must come to a place where we
realize that everything in our life is held together by GOD, and GOD
alone! Don't vainly think you are the exception, and you can take
care of your own home. God is the builder and protector of the home!
Stop and thank Him for His provision and protection in your life.
