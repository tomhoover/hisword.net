_Romans 12:10  
Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor
preferring one another._

If at all possible, we should try to patronize Christian
establishments and help Christian people when we can. Showing
kindness to fellow Christians is one of the most important things you
can do for your church. When you serve others, and put them before
yourself, you are actually making your church stronger. Who could you
encourage today in your church? Would you call that new person who
usually sits alone?
