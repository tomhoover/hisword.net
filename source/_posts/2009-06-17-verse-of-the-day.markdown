_Lamentations 3:22-23  
22 It is of the Lord&rsquo;s mercies that we are not consumed,
because His compassions fail not.  
23They are new every morning: great is Thy faithfulness._

You've got a new set of the Lord's mercies waiting on you to begin
this day. You just might think you went over your quota yesterday,
but God says He will give you an unending fresh supply every day.
Think about God's faithfulness to you, and be determined to
faithfully tell someone about Him today!
