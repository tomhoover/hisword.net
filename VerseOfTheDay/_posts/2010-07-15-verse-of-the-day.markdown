_Psalm 27:13  
I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD
in the land of the living._

What an encouragement! There are times when the cares of this world
might seemingly overtake you if weren't for that third "eye" of faith
that sees God's hand caring for you. Just catching the vision of
God's "goodness" in this despairing world, should encourage you! You
are blessed Christian, rejoice in God's goodness in your life!
