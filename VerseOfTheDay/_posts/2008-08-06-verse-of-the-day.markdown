_Hebrews 10:23  
Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for
He is faithful that promised.)_

God is faithfully holding the universe in space and caring for all
His children. He has been faithful to keep all His promises that are
recorded in the Bible. What can you do for God today? Be faithful to
speak and act like a Christian, even when you are weary!
