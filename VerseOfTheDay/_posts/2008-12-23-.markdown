_Matthew 1:21  
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus:
for He shall save His people from their sins._

If you count today, there are only two more shopping days to get
your gifts and homes ready for Christmas. The time is also slipping
away for people who don't know Jesus, to be saved. Jesus came to save
people from their sins. Soon it will be too late! Be ready for
Christ's return!
