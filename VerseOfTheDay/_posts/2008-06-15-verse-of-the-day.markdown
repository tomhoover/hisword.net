title: June 15th - God&rsquo;s Place of Peace
---

_Romans 10:15  
And how shall they preach, unless they be sent? as it is written How
beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and
bring glad tidings of good things._

It&rsquo;s Sunday and the day set aside to honor Fathers. As you do
this, be thankful for your Heavenly Father and His love and compassion
for every human being&rsquo;s needs. In wanting the best for you, your
Heavenly Father has placed pastors in churches all over the world to
guide and direct people like you. It&rsquo;s a good thing to give
thanks unto the Lord.
