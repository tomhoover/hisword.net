_I Corinthians 15:54  
So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this
mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass
the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory._

Victory over death is a done deal for those who accept Christ as
their Savior. What about victory in your daily life? Don&rsquo;t let
this be just another day upon earth. Be alive in Jesus and tell
someone about Him today!
