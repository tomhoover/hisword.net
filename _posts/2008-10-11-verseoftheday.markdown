title: October 11th - The Basics of Partnership

_Psalm 40:4a  
Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust._

Many financial world investments are in trouble today and being
bailed out by our government. When you partner with God, your
investments are sent to heaven ahead of you, and they are absolutely
secure. The investment that God will call you to make today is an
investment in the lives of others. Give that cup of cold water, a
coat, or a word of encouragement to a lonely soul. That's called
investing in futures!
