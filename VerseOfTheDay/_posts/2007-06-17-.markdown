_John 14:2-4  
2 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would
have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.  
3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and
receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.  
4 And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know._

Peter tells that we are pilgrims and strangers here in this life.
Our home is in heaven, in our Father's house. Long before Expedia or
Hotels.com, our Lord Jesus has prepared and reserved a place for us
in the Father's House. By faith in Christ, His Father is our Father,
and His House is our House! He will return with the title deed to our
place in Heaven with Him.
