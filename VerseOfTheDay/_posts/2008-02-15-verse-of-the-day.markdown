_Psalm 36:7  
How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children
of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings._

God&rsquo;s wings represent security for His children. In our world
there are very few absolutely secure things. God could give you an
opportunity today to share His love with someone who is struggling
with insecurity. Be looking for them!
