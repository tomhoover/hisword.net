_Psalm 28:7  
The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in Him, and
I am helped; therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song
will I praise him._

You don't have to sing notes to have a song. The song of praise,
starts with a full heart of love and thanks to the Almighty God. How
has the Lord helped you lately? Out of an overflowing heart, name it
and praise Him, out loud. Your praise is music to God's ears!
