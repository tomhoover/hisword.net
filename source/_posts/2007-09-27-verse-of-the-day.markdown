_II Thessalonians 2:16-17  
16 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father,
which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and
good hope through grace,  
17 Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and
work._

Every believer needs to be grounded and established in the faith!
This is what the Thessalonian church needed, and it is what we need.
The Word of God will lead the believer to be baptized in a sound
church and thereby to become a member of that church. There you can
grow to be established in every good word (your talk), and in every
good work (your walk).
