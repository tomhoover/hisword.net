_Psalm 23:2  
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the
still waters._

To sheep "green pastures" represent food. To the believer, "green
pastures," represent God's Word, or spiritual food, for the soul. God
has given you His Word to comfort and guide you through this life.
When you read His Word, the Holy Spirit leads you beside the still
waters, or He quiets your soul as He speaks to you. If your heart is
troubled today, God made you to find comfort in His Word! Go to it!
