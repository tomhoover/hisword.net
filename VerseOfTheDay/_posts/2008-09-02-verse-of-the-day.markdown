title: September 2nd - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_I John 1:9  
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive our sins,
and cleanse us from all unrighteousness._

You aren't perfect! You will probably have to confess your sins
more than once today. It pleases our faithful and merciful God when
you humble yourself and admit your imperfection. It will also help
you sleep better!
