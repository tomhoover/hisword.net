_I Corinthians 10:13  
There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but
God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye
are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape,
that ye may be able to bear it._

This is a "no excuse verse!" You will be tempted, but not with more
than you can bear. God has given you a way out of every temptation, if
you will trust Him and ask Him for His help. God is FAITH FULL! He
blesses the lives of those who believe in Him with victory over
temptation! Victory is a prayer away!
