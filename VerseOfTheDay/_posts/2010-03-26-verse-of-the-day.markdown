title: March 26th - Extreme Love...is giving.
---

_I John 3:16  
Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life
for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren._

The profound beauty of giving is in the transformation it brings
about in our lives. When you are willing to give up something that
you are for someone else, it is then that you see what you can
become, a lovely person in God's eyes. Give yourself to God today.
