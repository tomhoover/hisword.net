_Psalm 55:22  
Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and He shall sustain thee: He shall
never suffer the righteous to be moved._

Are you carrying a burden today? Could you use some "spiritual
protection" from this present evil world? It's a dangerous thing to
begin your day without prayer. Prayer is the most important thing you
will do today! It will make the difference between success or failure.
Your Partner promises to take care of you, but you must call upon
Him.
