_Psalm 118:21  
I will praise Thee: for Thou hast heard me, and art become my
salvation._

Has God answered your prayers lately? Did He save you from
something that, at the time, you just thought was going to ruin your
life? Take a minute and praise the Lord. Sing a song to Him, as David
would often do. Answered prayers bring the realization that God is
very near to you. God has touched your life, praise Him!
