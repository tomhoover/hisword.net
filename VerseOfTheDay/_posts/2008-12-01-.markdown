_Matthew 6:33  
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all
these things shall be added unto you._

Are you ready? You are entering one of the busiest months of the
year, with shopping, programs, and events. You must be purposed to
put God first, or it will never happen. Stop and ask God to help you
make the best investment of your time and money. You are going to
need His help!
