title: December 10th - FaithLight...lighting your world through Faith in
---

_Psalm 18:28  
For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my
darkness._

Need some encouragement today? Just as the sun has FAITHFULLY come
up today, the LORD God will shed the warmth of His LIGHT upon you if
you will but ask Him. Open the windows of heaven through prayer and
watch His LIGHT shine all around you! He's FAITHFUL to keep His
promise to encourage you, if you will but turn your eyes upward to
His LIGHT!
