title: December 5th - God's Place of Provision
---

_Philippians 4:19  
But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in
glory by Christ Jesus._

As you make your Christmas list for family, examine needs versus
wants. This will simplify your gift giving and will free you up to
help others.
