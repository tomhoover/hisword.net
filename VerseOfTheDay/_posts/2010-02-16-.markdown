_II Timothy 2:1  
Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ
Jesus._

Find your strength for today in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
Friends are good to encourage when they can, but they won't always
understand you. Real strength to live your life will come from Jesus
alone. Friends can only see outward circumstances, Jesus understands
and sees your heart. Give your burdens to the Lord and leave them
there!
