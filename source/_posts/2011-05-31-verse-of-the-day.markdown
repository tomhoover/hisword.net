_I Corinthians 15:58  
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your
labor is not in vain in the Lord._

Okay, here we are at the end of the month, and hopefully you
haven't had a WHOLE month of trials! God's Words are the same today
as they were at the first of May. They are: "Have FAITH!" Don't let
the evil one get a victory in your life! Stay in the battle and keep
fighting the good fight of FAITH! The Lord is searching for FAITH in
these last days! Stand strong and keep serving the LORD!
