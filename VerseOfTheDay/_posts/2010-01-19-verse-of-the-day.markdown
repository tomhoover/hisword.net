_Romans 15:3  
For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The
reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me._

Jesus Christ occupied a fleshly body while He was on this earth. We
are told that He was tempted in all things as we are, yet He remained
perfect. Somehow we want to believe that He had no struggles with His
fleshly nature, but the Scriptures tell us that He chose to deny self,
to please His heavenly Father. If you could get a "fresh glimpse" of
heaven today, you might have that same desire to please your heavenly
Father. Help us to see You today, Lord, and stir up our hearts!
