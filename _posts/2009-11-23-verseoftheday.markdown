title: November 23rd - Extreme Love...Is Kind
---

_Psalm 119:88  
Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony
of thy mouth._

Do you listen to God's voice when He tells you to respond with kind
words to those who are unkind to you? It may be a telephone solicitor,
a tired store clerk, a rude child, or an impatient friend. Be warned
that you will encounter one of these today. Take a moment to prepare
your heart, so that you will be able to respond with love and
kindness.
