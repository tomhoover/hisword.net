_Psalm 91:1  
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide
under the shadow of the Almighty._

The blessings promised in this verse are not for every believer,
but only for those who are in close fellowship with the Lord. When
you pull up close to the Lord, you are protected from evil. His
outstretched arms cover you with His power and love. Find that secret
place where you can draw close and worship the Lord with all your
heart today!
