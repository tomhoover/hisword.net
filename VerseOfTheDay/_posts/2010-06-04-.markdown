title: June 4th - Extreme Love...rejoices in truth.
---

_Philippians 1:18  
What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in
truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will
rejoice._

Celebrate TRUTH today! You may not agree with everything that your
friends and brethren embrace, but if they believe in Jesus Christ
alone as their Savior, you can REJOICE in that! Acknowledging a
personal relationship with Jesus Christ is the most important TRUTH
for every life! You must constantly remind yourself to keep Jesus
Christ as the focus of your life. He will make you REJOICE!
