_Psalm 31:23  
O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth the
faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer._

Your eyes should lovingly be upon the Lord today, Christian! Don't
look at the injustice, sin, and problems of this world. It is the
Lord who will faithfully take care of you, as He alone knows and
judges your heart correctly. In those "waiting" moments during your
day, speak love from your heart to your God.
