_Isaiah 26:3  
Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee:
because he trusteth in thee._

According to this verse, there is a direct connection between what
you are thinking and your peace of mind. As you begin your day, pray
and ask God to help you think more about Him, and less about your
self. Peace is a promised gift from God when your focus is on the
Prince of Peace.
