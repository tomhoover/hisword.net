_II Timothy 2:24  
And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all
men, apt to teach, patient._

There is a song called, "The Battle Belongs to the Lord," and that
is what our verse for today is saying. You should patiently defer to
the Lord, rather than taking things into your own hands. By the way,
patience is not a one time thing. It happens again and again. Your
servant example is being observed by a watching world, every day.
