_John 17:4  
I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which
thou gavest me to do._

Jesus has given every one of His children a job to do for Him. Your
gifts and talents were not given to you for your own profit. They are
given to you to be used to glorify God. Someday, when you get to
heaven, Jesus will ask you, "What did you do with the gifts I've
given you?" May you be encouraged in your work for the Lord today, so
one day you will be able to say, "I have finished the work which you
have given me to do!"
