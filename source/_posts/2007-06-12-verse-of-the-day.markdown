_Isaiah 58:11  
And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in
drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered
garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not._

This verse voices the mystery of faith. God's people, in Christ,
can and will experience the blessings of a healthy spirit and a
prospering soul that continue in abundance even in the drought that a
sin-cursed earth can produce. Like the widow and Elisha, God will
continue to increase the oil of our spirit by the power of His Holy
Spirit in our lives as we walk with Him.
