_Matthew 21:21  
Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have
faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the
fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou
removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done._

Have you got some mountains in your life? Have you got some things
that it seems are just impossible in earthly terms, to happen?
Mountains are built with layers of rock and dirt stacked tightly
together. It wouldn't be a mountain if you could see through it, or
it had holes in it. The same can be said for FAITH. A Christian's
FAITH should be solidly laid upon Jesus Christ, not allowing space
for any holes of doubt. When your FAITH plugs up the holes of doubt,
it becomes a powerful tool for God to use to bring Himself glory! It
changes your attitude from "impossible" to "absolutely, going to
happen, POSSIBLE!"
