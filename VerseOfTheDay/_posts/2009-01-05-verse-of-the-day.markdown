_Deuteronomy 31:8  
And the Lord, He it is that doth go before thee; He will be with
thee, He will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither
be dismayed._

You are not alone! God is your Partner and He has pledged to be
with you today. If you will discipline your mind to remember that His
presence is with you, it will make a huge difference in what you
accomplish today.
