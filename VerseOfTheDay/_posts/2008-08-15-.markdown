_Psalm 63:7  
Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings
will I rejoice._

Do you ever wish that you had wings that could lift you above all
the trials of this life? Rejoice! Through prayer God can lift you
above your trials and circumstances, and lighten your load. When you
really TRUST God, you don&rsquo;t need wings, you just need Him!
