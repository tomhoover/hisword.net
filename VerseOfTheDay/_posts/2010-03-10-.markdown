title: March 10th - Extreme Love...is giving.
---

_Romans 12:20  
Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him
drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head._

Winston Churchill said, "We make a living by what we get, but we
make a life by what we give." Giving even small things in response to
those who give you grief, will re-shape your life and bring about
change in both sides of a relationship. May your thoughts be centered
upon your Lord's example, today, and may you generously give out of
the abundance of your overflowing heart.
