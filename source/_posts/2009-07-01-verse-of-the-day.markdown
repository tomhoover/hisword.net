_Galatians 2:20  
I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but
Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I
live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself
for me._

Our verse calls every Christian to be prepared to make a sacrifice
for the sake of Christ today! Knowing you are secure in God's love
should give you the courage to live a bold life for Him. You become
"alive in Christ" when you are willing to give up your will and your
desires, in order to please Him.
