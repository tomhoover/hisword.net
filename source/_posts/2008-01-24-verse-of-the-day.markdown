_I Peter 3:22  
Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and
authorities and powers being made subject unto him._

There is nothing that will come to you that first didn't go past
God. If you have given Him your heart, how would He let anything come
your way that wasn&rsquo;t for your good? Trust God&rsquo;s hand
today.
