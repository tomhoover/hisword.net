title: December 15th - God's Place of Provision
---

_James 1:17  
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh
down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither
shadow of turning._

j "I'm gettin' nuthin' for Christmas..."l The gifts of Christ are
the fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, and self control. These are the perfect
gifts for that difficult person on your list. Share the gospel with
someone today.
