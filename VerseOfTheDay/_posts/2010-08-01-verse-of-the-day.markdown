title: August 1st - Extreme Love...hopes and believes the best.
---

_I Corinthians 13:7b  
Believeth all things..._

Those who have lived a measure of life, often find themselves
predisposed to see the "bad" before they see the "good." Negative
thought patterns are not of God. He wants His children to believe the
best until it's proven otherwise. This is not a natural reaction,
therefore, you must ask God to help you focus on the potential of His
power in your life, over past negative experiences and voices. It's a
choice between happiness or fear. Will you choose to "believe the
best" today? Extreme LOVE factors in God and believes the best.
