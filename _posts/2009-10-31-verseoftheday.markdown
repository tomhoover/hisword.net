title: October 31st - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_Lamentations 3:25  
The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that
seeketh him._

You have had a month of focusing upon being a more patient person.
St. Augustine said, "Patience is the companion of wisdom." A wise
person will always wait on the LORD and seek His will above their own
desires. If you have been inspired to be more patient, and applied
God's truth to your life, then you are a wiser person and better for
the journey. Don't stop now. Make patience a permanent part of your
life!
