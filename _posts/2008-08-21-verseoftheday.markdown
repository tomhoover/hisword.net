_Psalm 18:3  
I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I
be saved from my enemies._

Make a note that every time your phone rings today you will be
mindful to praise the LORD! Think of all the times God has delivered
you from bad situations, and you might just want to praise the LORD
all day long! Smile!
