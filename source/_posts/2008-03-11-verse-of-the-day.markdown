_Psalm 62:8  
Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before
him: God is a refuge for us. Selah._

God wants you to trust Him when you experience both need and
abundance. Do you find yourself calling upon Him in both situations?
God wants to hear your &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; as well as your
&ldquo;requests&rdquo;.
