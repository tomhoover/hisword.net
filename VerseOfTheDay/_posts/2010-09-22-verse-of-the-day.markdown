title: September 22nd - Extreme Love...endures through trials.
---

_Philippians 4:19  
But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in
glory by Christ Jesus._

Economically, these are challenging days. Although we think of it
far too little, it is quite a comfort to be a child of the King. Your
heavenly Father is rich in possessions that go beyond your
imagination, to be able to provide for your needs. Our verse attaches
these riches to Christ Jesus, understanding that they are made
possible through Him. That makes your relationship with Jesus Christ
the most valuable possession in your life! Do you understand what you
have in Jesus Christ? EXTREME LOVE made it possible! Thank Him!
