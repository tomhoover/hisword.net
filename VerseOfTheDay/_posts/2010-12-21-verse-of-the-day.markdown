_Ephesians 5:8  
For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord:
walk as children of light._

People need LIGHT to live healthy lives, both physically and
spiritually. Those who abide under the laws of God can rest from
fear, basing their FAITH on the fact that He is in control. Are you
walking in the LIGHT or DARKNESS? Are you walking in FAITH or FEAR?
Your choice will determine whether you have a good day or a bad
day!
