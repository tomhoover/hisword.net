_Romans 4:16  
Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the
promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of
the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is
the father of us all._

Abraham believed God and was called a man of FAITH! God used
Abraham to bless your life and the lives of many others. Abraham was
a human being, just like you, yet he holds forth an example that if
he could do it, so can you. He also speaks to the FAITH FULL NESS of
a Holy God to help your FAITH grow! Be encouraged Christian, FAITH's
reward is still a promise for YOU today!
