_Jeremiah 29:11  
For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD,
thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end._

God is thinking about you today! He knows you and thinks about you
every day if you are His child. He wants you to make righteous
choices that will bring peace and prosperity to your life. God is not
only thinking about you today, He will give you peace, when you stay
away from evil.
