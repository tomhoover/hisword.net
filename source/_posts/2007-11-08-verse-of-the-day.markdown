_Luke 4:18-19  
18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to
preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the
brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering
of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,  
19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord._

God's healing is more about your soul than your body. You are rich
in things that money can't buy. Share your wealth with the lost
world.
