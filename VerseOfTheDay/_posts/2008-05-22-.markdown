title: May 22nd - God&rsquo;s Place of Victory
---

_Psalm 94:22  
But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge._

Hooray! God is the rock, and He will protect and defend you!
Instead of taking things into your own hands today, defer to God. He
can handle all your problems, and the victory is so sweet!
