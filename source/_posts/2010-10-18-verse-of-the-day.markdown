_Matthew 21:22  
And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye
shall receive._

In this "hurry-up" world we live in, a quiet time for prayer can be
shoved aside! This is just one of Satan's evil plans to make your
Christian life FAITH-Less. The Evil one knows that there is power in
prayer. He will keep you so busy and preoccupied with yourself, that
you have no time to strengthen your FAITH through prayer. If things
aren't happening in your life, it could be you need to reconnect with
your power source, Jesus Christ. Give Him more than 30 seconds. Open
your heart and express your belief in Him! Who knows, you might just
pray through your lunch hour! FAITH FULL!
