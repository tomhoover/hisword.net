_Isaiah 49:4  
Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for
nought, and in vain; yet surely my judgment is with the Lord, and my
work with my God._

When your work for the Lord doesn't seem to be getting any good
results, stop and examine if you are working "with" God, or by
yourself. God promises that when you work with Him, He will bring
about the change, but it comes in His time. Are you "working with
God?"
