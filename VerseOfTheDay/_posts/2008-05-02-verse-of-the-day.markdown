_Psalm 108:1  
O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my
glory._

According to Spurgeon, this Psalm is called "The Warrior&rsquo;s
Morning Song." David is strengthening his heart before entering into
the conflicts of his day. Do you recognize, as David did, that you
must purpose to sing and praise God with your mind today, or it
won&rsquo;t happen?
