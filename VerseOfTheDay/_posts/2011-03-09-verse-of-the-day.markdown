_Hebrews 11:11  
Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed,
and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she
judged him faithful who had promised._

How important was Sara's FAITH? If she hadn't had FAITH, would she
have given birth to Isaac? At some point, Sara committed herself to
believe God's promise. God gives every one of us a free will to
accept or reject His promises. It could be that many of us miss out
on God's miracles, because we don't believe His promises. How
important is your FAITH? It will make a difference in your destiny
and everything in life until you get there!
