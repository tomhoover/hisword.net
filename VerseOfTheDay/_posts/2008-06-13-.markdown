title: June 13th - God&rsquo;s Place of Peace
---

_Matthew 10:34  
Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send
peace, but a sword._

Sometimes your faith, will divide relationships. Light and darkness
are exclusive of each other. If this was true for Jesus, it will be
true for you also. Take a moment to thank God for the relationships
you have in Christ, and the peace you share with believers of like
faith.
