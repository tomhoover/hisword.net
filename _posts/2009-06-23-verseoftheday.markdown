title: June 23rd - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith
---

_I Peter 1:8  
Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not,
yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory._

FAITH is believing in something you haven't actually seen yet. You
don't have to see what you believe in to be changed by it. God's
touch in the life of the Christian is unmistakable! FAITH changes
hate and sadness into love and joy. Christian you have been changed!
Wear that love and joy upon your face today! Many are searching, and
can't see the Light.
