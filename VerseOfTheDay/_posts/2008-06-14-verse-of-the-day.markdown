_John 18:36  
Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were
of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be
delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence._

Jesus was very confident in who He was and He didn&rsquo;t let the
words from the people of this world influence Him. As you go through
your day, ask God to help you keep the proper focus of living for
eternity and not to be influenced by people and things of this world.
This will also bring peace to your life.
