_Psalm 27:1  
The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord
is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?_

If you aren't careful, "fear" can keep you from living your life at
its very best. Nothing in this life is going to happen to you until
your work for God on this earth is done. Another way of saying that
is, "God is with you and He's watching over every step you take." Why
should you be afraid? Get out of the boat and walk on the water. The
Master is holding your hand!
