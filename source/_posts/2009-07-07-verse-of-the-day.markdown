_Romans 12:21  
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good._

There will be some time during this day when you will be
mistreated, and you will be tempted to give it back. May this verse
come to your mind and keep you from evil. When you treat others
kindly and better than they deserve, you are most like the Savior who
made the supreme sacrifice.
