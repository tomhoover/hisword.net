_Psalm 119:151  
Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion
over me._

How is that New Year's resolution coming along? Did you know that
God gives strength to do the right thing, when you read His Word?
God's Word will actually encourage you and point you in the right
direction. It will keep sin at the door, if you will follow its
instruction. You can do it! (With His help!)
