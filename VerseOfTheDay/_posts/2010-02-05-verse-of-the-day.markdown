title: February 5th - Extreme Love...is gracious, not rude.
---

_Colossians 4:6  
Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may
know how ye ought to answer every man._

If you will purpose to show more grace to others, more
understanding, more acceptance, it might just save your life and keep
harm away. Just as salt is used to preserve certain foods, grace will
preserve your life. Grace turns hateful words into loving words.
Grace answers indifference with inclusiveness. Grace faces fears with
God's acceptance. Pray for God's grace to be revealed in your speech
today!
