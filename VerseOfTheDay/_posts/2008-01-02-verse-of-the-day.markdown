_Isaiah 26:4  
Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is
everlasting strength._

Keeping resolutions depends upon God and you. Ask God to strengthen
your resolve, and purpose to trust Him. Change will cost YOU
something, but it will be nothing compared to being with the Lord
forever!
