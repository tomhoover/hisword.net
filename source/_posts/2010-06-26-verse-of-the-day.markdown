_Colossians 1:5-6  
For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard
before in the word of the truth of the gospel; Which is come unto
you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth
also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God
in truth._

Our verse is reminding the Christian that the same hope that you
put your trust in for eternal life, the gospel of TRUTH, is still
active in this world. In other words, the TRUTH is still powerful to
change the hearts and lives of those who will believe. Just in case
you are discouraged and think no one is giving their heart to Jesus,
be encouraged, the TRUTH is still alive on planet earth! Remember,
you never fail when you witness, you can only fail to witness.
