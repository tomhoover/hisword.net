title: August 28th - Partnership with God for a Changed Life

_John 9:4  
I must work the works of Him that sent me, while it is day: the
night cometh, when no man can work._

It's happening all around you! The world is changing and things are
in place for the Lord's return! You've got to get busy. What will you
do for God today? You might not have much time left, and what about
your friends?
