_Ephesians 4:32  
And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you._

This is a verse often quoted in our home while one brother was
clobbering another brother. It is one of two great principles of life
for the Christian. One is the Golden Rule, "whatsoever ye would that
men should do to you, do ye even so to them" (Matt. 7:12). The other
is communicated here; be kind, tender and forgiving to one another
because God, in the person of Jesus Christ, has been kind, tender and
forgiving to us. Living by these rules will enhance your life
immensely.
