title: March 2nd - God&rsquo;s Place of Promise
---

_II Corinthians 1:20  
For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto
the glory of God by us._

The promises of God are guaranteed by God Himself. You
couldn&rsquo;t get a more absolute done deal! As you think about all
the answered prayers in your life, be reminded God does keep His
promises and He gets the glory!
