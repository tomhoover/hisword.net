_I Peter 4:19  
Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit
the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as unto a faithful
Creator._

You are reminded in your verse today that you don't need to tell
God that you are suffering. You just need to tell God that you are
trusting Him. He made you and He will faithfully care for you. TRUST
GOD!
