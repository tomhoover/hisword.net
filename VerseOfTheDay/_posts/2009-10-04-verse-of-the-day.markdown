title: October 4th - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_Ephesians 4:2  
With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one
another in love._

People in the world today have an attitude of expecting, and even
demanding "right treatment" by others. Christians are called to
humbly deny their own "rights" for the good of others. The
empowerment to do this was demonstrated in the life of Jesus, who
became meek and lowly, not demanding His rights, in order to bring
honor and glory to His Father. Ask Jesus to help you LOVE like He
did! You can do it with His help!
