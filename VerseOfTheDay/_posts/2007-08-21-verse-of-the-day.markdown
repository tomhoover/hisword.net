_I Corinthians 3:16  
Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of
God dwelleth in you?_

This verse is a glorious church promise. Each church that God
recognizes as one of His churches, teaching "the faith" and
fulfilling the Great Commission, has the promise of the presence and
power of the Holy Spirit upon them. A local, New Testament church is
a "Temple of God," a "body of Christ", and a "pillar and ground of
the truth." It is the institution of God on earth and it is to the
believer's greatest advantage to serve the Lord and grow in the Lord
inside a church&rsquo;s God ordained authority.
