title: April 20th- God&rsquo;s Place of Care
---

_Psalm 28:7  
The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and
I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song
will I praise him._

Do you need a blessing today? God will bless and help those who put
their trust in Him. Instead of worrying about a problem, sing
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s able, He&rsquo;s able, I know my God is able to
carry me through!&rdquo; You are blessed, smile!
