title: November 16th - Extreme Love...Is Kind
---

_Psalm 141:3  
Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips._

Kindness is shown as much by what you don't say, as by what you do
say, to those around you. Ask the Lord to put a watch over your mouth
that would keep you from saying anything that might be hurtful to
others.
Speak kindness!
