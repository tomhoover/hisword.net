_John 11:40- 41  
Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest
believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? Then they took away the
stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his
eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me._

Jesus is reminding Mary and Martha of the connection between POWER
and FAITH. He told them, that if they wanted to see the glory of God,
there was a prerequisite. They must believe! How many times do we miss
seeing the POWER and glory of God, because we simply don't believe
GOD? Believe God's promises! They are POWER FULL!
