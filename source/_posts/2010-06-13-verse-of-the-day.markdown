_Psalm 43:3  
O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring
me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles._

Sir William Hamilton said, /"Truth, is like a torch, the more it's
shook the more it shines."/ The TRUTH of God's Word continues to
withstand the denial and rejection of this world, therefore we are
given the job to keep shaking our torch. Invite someone to go to
church with you today! TRUTH speaks for itself!
