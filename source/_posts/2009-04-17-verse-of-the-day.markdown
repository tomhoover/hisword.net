_Psalm 139:23-24  
23 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my
thoughts:  
24 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way
everlasting._

These verses are really a prayer to the Almighty God, to look at
the inside of the heart. Sometimes it's very hard for you to look at
yourself objectively. David asked God to reveal his heart. God used a
preacher's message (Nathan), and a circumstance (a rebellious child,
Absalom) to reveal David's heart. Aristotle said, /"I count him
braver who overcomes his desires than him who conquers his enemies;
for the hardest victory is over self."/ Will you ask God to search
heart so you can have a victorious life?
