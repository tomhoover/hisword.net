_Proverbs 31:30  
Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman that feareth
the Lord, she shall be praised._

Happy Mother&rsquo;s Day! If there is a beautiful godly woman in
your life who fears God, you should praise her today! Physical beauty
is measured only by what you see outwardly. Spiritual beauty is
measured inwardly, as a result of a relationship with God. Spiritual
beauty endures time and eternity. Praise God for spiritual women,
they have true beauty!
