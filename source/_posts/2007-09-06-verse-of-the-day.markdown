_Proverbs 3:5-6  
5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine
own understanding.  
6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths._

For the Christian, it is not about what we think, but who we are.
It's not about what we think that we can do or want to do, but what
God wants to do through us. Christ in us and the knowledge of God
that He brings is the "treasure" that we possess in "earthen vessels"
(our flesh). If we trust the Lord with our vessel by surrendering it
to Him, He will direct our path for His honor and glory, exalting us
in the process.
