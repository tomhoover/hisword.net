_Psalm 119:57  
Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy
words._

Did you hear the WORD "FAITH" in our verse? Some think David wrote
this verse and that he was declaring his FAITH in God to be the judge
and protector of his life. In other words, he's not putting his trust
in man, but in GOD. The author is saying he will obey GOD, no matter
the consequences! Will you do the same today?
