title: August 20th - Partnership with God for a Changed Life

_II Corinthians 4:16  
For which cause, we faint not; but though our outward man perish,
yet the inward man is renewed day by day._

The summer heat may be getting to you, but don't faint! Renew your
inward man, if you can't renew your outward man. Change your thinking
to reflect God, rather than dwelling on your present outward
circumstances. God is bigger than all your problems. Don't faint!
Change your attitude!
