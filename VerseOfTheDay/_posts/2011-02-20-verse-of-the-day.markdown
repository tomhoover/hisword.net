_Psalm 125:1  
They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be
removed, but abideth for ever._

Mountain FAITH is ROCK solid FAITH!! It's the kind of FAITH that
doesn't give up, give in, or give out, when life gets difficult.
Mountain Faith loses its personal identity and conforms itself to
"The ROCK," Jesus Christ! Jesus kept His eyes on His purpose, Mount
Calvary, and you must embrace your mountain, as He did! FAITH
FORCE!
