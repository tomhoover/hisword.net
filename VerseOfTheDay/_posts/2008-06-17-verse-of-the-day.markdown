_Philippians 4:7  
And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep
your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus._

Do you need some help keeping your heart and mind focused on the
right things? Help is as close as the mention of Jesus&rsquo; name.
Take time to ask Him to help you today, and the peace of God will
come to your aid. Be prepared for something spectacular to happen
today. God is bigger and greater than you could ever imagine!
