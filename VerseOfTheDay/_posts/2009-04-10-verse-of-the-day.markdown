_John 11:25  
Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that
believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live._

You can be so busy getting ready for Easter that you can miss the
impact of the greatest life ever lived! Take a moment to reflect
upon: Jesus on the cross; Jesus buried in a tomb; The risen Jesus.
Meditate on the thought that Jesus did this for you. You will be able
to live throughout eternity because of His sacrifice for you! What a
Savior!
