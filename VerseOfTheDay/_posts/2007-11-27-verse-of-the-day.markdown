title: November 27th - God's Place of Healing
---

_Jeremiah 17:14  
Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be
saved: for thou art my praise._

Praise God for spiritual healing that restores the joy of your
salvation. Take time today to laugh; it is the praise music of the
soul.
