title: May 9th - God&rsquo;s Place of Victory
---

_Psalm 20:5  
We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will
set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions._

Be happy! Put on that smile and wear the banner of
&ldquo;victory&rdquo; on your countenance. God keeps all His
promises, and the victory banner has been on display ever since
Jesus&rsquo; death and resurrection. Are you smiling yet?
