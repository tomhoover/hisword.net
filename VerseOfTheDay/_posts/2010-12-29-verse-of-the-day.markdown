_I John 1:7  
But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
cleanseth us from all sin._

Not only do you not have to be perfect, neither do others! When you
come to understand the grace of God, it will change your relationship
with those around you. Judgment belongs to God alone. The LIGHT helps
you to see others as forgiven sinners, just like yourself. LORD, may
Your LIGHT shine down on my heart today, and may I love all people as
You do!
