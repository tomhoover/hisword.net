_Romans 12:21  
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good._

He's sneaky! He will whisper in your ear that you should "honk your
horn!" After all, you never make any driving mistakes! He will say,
"Speak up for yourself and tell that store clerk with the bad
attitude off. You deserve better." Or he might just whisper, "Nobody
you know is around. Go ahead and do it!" Throughout every day you
hear that voice! Your verse today reminds you to take charge of your
thoughts, because every thought has the potential to become an
action. Listen to God's voice today and "DO GOOD! May love and
kindness fill you!"
