title: November 1st - Partnership with God in Prayer
---

_Jeremiah 33:3  
Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty
things, which thou knowest not._

In our partnership with God, prayer is one of our biggest
challenges. We tend to put our own human limitations upon God. If we
can do something in our own abilities, we often won't call upon Him.
God tells us that we are missing a lot of great and mighty things by
not including Him in EVERY area of our lives. Have you forgotten that
He can still part the Red Sea? He can still do things you can't
imagine! Take the challenge and call upon God!
