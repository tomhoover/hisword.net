title: August 5th - Extreme Love...hopes and believes the best.

_Psalm 42:11  
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the
health of my countenance, and my God._

It's a choice! You can believe the promises of God, or you can
believe the discouragement and lies of Satan. In every circumstance
in which you find yourself in this life, there will be some good, if
you will but look for it. Are you focusing on God's goodness or
Satan's trials? If you can praise God, it even becomes a good dose of
health for your body.
