_Luke 2:8-9  
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,
keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the
Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about
them: and they were sore afraid._

When was the last time you looked into the sky at night? Sometimes
living in the city it can be hard to see the stars for the reflection
of the city lights. The city lights represent distractions that keep
us from clearly seeing the true LIGHT of the world. God wants your
undivided attention. It can be difficult in this busy season to keep
your FAITH and eyes on Jesus, but it is rewarding. You wouldn't want
to miss what God is wanting to say to you.
