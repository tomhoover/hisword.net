_Psalm 25:5  
Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my
salvation; on thee do I wait all the day._

There are a lot of "daily's" in the Christian life! Have you ever
thought of "TRUTH discovery" as being a "daily discipline?" In other
words, there will always be some "new TRUTH" to learn about God and
His will for your life, every day. If that's true, and that's what
our verse says, before you start each day, TRUTH should be a part of
your "daily prayer."
/"God lead me and teach me your TRUTH, today!"/
