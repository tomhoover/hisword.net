_Lamentations 3:22-23  
It is of the LORD&rsquo;s mercies that we are not consumed, because
His compassions fail not. They are new every morning: Great is thy
faithfulness._

While you were sleeping last night, a fresh bunch of
&ldquo;mercy&rdquo; was thrown down from heaven to cover your life
today. God gives us His mercy every day, and most of the time we take
it and His faithfulness for granted. Stop and thank God for faithfully
covering you with mercy today and every day of your life!
