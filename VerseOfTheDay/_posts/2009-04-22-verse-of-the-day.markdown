_Psalm 37:7  
Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself
because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who
bringeth wicked devices to pass._

God will judge everything on this earth one day according to the
cross. It may look like the wicked are getting the best deals right
now, but if you will rest in the Lord and be patient, God will even
the score. May you remember this thought today, when injustice visits
your life.
