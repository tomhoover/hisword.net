_John 15:4  
Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide
in me._

If you are to serve the Lord, you must abide in Him, or know Him
and His Word thoroughly. It is only through spending time with Him,
that you can become closer to Him. As you do this, God will test your
obedience. God knows that when FAITH has moved from your head to your
heart it will be expressed through your life to others, in a
fruitFULL way that will glorify Him. Someone put it this way, "Stay
so close to Jesus, that not even a slimy snake could get between
you!"
