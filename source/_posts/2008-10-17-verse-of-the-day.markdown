_John 15:5  
I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in
him: the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do
nothing._

Think about the Almighty God that is bigger than anything you can
even imagine, and then think about the fact that He wants to be
personally connected to you. Why would you not want to mentally and
spiritually include Him in your life? Stop and ask Him to help you be
aware of His presence today!
