_John 20:29  
Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast
believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have
believed._

Did you make Easter services yesterday? Were you REALLY there? Did
you feel the presence of the resurrected JESUS personally as the
story was told? In our verse, Thomas was in the wrong place and
missed Jesus. Don't miss JESUS! He's the center of everything! May
you have a renewed passion to be in His presence with His people!
