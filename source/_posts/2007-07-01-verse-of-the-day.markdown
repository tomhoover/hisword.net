_Psalm 36:9  
For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see
light._

Light is at its most precious and its most glorious as it pierces
the darkness all around it. The presence of Christ in our lives is a
perpetual light that is a beacon to the lightless lost among us. They
are drawn to it in ways they cannot see, nor understand. Don't cover
your light with the bushel of the world or the flesh, but let your
light so shine to the world that they are continually drawn to Jesus
Christ in you, the Light of Life.
