_Philippians 2:4-5  
4 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the
things of others.  
5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus._

This is the principle of other-centeredness. This is the mind of
Christ which played itself out from the womb of Mary, to the cross of
Calvary, to the Father&rsquo;s right hand in heaven. When you think
about it, doesn&rsquo;t presenting your body as a living sacrifice to
the Lord result in living a life of service that puts the needs of
others above your own? So humble yourself before God and He will
exalt you in His time and in His way, which is always better than our
time and way.
