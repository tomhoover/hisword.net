_Psalm 69:1  
Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul._

There are days when you can become so overcome with burdens of this
life, that you feel like David. It&rsquo;s like a boat that takes on
water. You&rsquo;ve got to do something, or you will go under. David
called unto God, and you should do the same. Before the water gets
deep, stop and cry out to Him. God is faithful to save us from
ourselves and the many situations we get into.
