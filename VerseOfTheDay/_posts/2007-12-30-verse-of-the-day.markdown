_Romans 14:6  
He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that
regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that
eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that
eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks._

This is next to the last day of 2007. It's not just your day, it is
one of the last times in 2007 that you can serve the Lord. Make your
day count!
