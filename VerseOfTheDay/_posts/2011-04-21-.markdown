_Luke 23:34  
Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots._

Notice how Jesus deals with forgiving others. He routes His
thoughts, regarding injustice, through heaven's portals! He elevates
His thoughts. To forgive is to move on, not to think about the
offense anymore. Jesus didn't excuse them, endorse them, or condone
their sin. He just chose to think differently, and gave them to His
Father! Never forget that love and forgiveness will ALWAYS be one of
God's greatest evidences of POWER upon this earth!
