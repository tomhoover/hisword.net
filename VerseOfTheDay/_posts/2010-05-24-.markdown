title: May 24th - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.
---

_Romans 7:21  
I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with
me._

That's just the way it is sometimes! God speaks to us and asks us
to make a change in our lives, and we agree with Him, desiring to do
good. A few days later, we have slipped back into our "old ways" and
have done the thing that we said we wouldn't. Don't be discouraged,
instead, be dedicated! Re-commit yourself to the LORD anew, and with
His help you will grow stronger to resist evil! Be strong in the
LORD!
