_Psalm 105:3  
Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek
the Lord._

Do you like to be around happy people? God's children should be
happy people as our eternity is settled and nothing can separate us
from the love of God. You should rejoice in these blessings and it
should put a smile on your face! Be one of those happy people others
like to be around. It makes your Partner look good.
