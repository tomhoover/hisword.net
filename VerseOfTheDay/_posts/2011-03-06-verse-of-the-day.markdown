_Hebrews 11:8  
By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he
should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not
knowing whither he went._

Imagine packing up all your worldly possessions and getting in the
moving truck with no idea where you are going. Abraham did just that,
and has given the generations that follow him an awesome example of
FAITH. It's called "going without knowing" or "FAITH without sight."
God is still asking His children to obey Him! May you respond with
FAITH when the uncertainties of life come your way today!
