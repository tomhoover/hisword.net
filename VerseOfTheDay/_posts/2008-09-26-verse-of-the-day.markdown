title: September 26th - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Ephesians 1:7  
In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
sins, according to the riches of his grace._

The word redemption carries with it the meaning that as a slave to
sin, you are in need of someone to pay the price for your sins to be
forgiven. Grace is getting something you don't deserve. As you
personalize our verse, you understand that Jesus paid the price for
you to be able to connect with the Holy God, who cannot even look
upon your sin. When you confess your sins in Jesus' name and ask
forgiveness, God's blessings are free to flow, initially at salvation
and daily in your Christian walk. Do you need to stop and call upon
Jesus?
