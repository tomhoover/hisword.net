title: March 25th - Partnership with God to Touch Lives
---

_II Corinthians 2:14  
Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in
every place._

It's the middle of the week, and this could be just another
ordinary day in your life. On the other hand, if you want to make it
an exceptional day, start off by thanking God for all His wonderful
blessings in your life. Then as the day progresses, continue to thank
Him for all the small things in your life. By the end of the day, you
will be singing a tune! Thankful hearts truly get the best out of
life!
