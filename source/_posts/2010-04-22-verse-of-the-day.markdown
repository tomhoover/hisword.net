_Psalm 145:8  
The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of
great mercy._

Just as cars can run out of gasoline, your life can "run dry of
mercy and compassion." You must spend some time with your Lord if you
are to refuel your life with genuine love and compassion for others.
There is no substitute, or quick fixes, apart from time spent in His
Word and prayer. Don't run dry today, fill up your love tank!"
