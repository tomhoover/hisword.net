title: April 29th - Partnership with God for a Victorious Life
---

_Romans 12:21  
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good._

There are no shortcuts to victory. On your road to do something
great for God, you will experience injustice, false judgment,
jealousy, discouragement, setbacks, and road blocks. Don't let these
things overcome you. Ask God to fill you with His love, patience,
hope, faith, and self control. This is the life of a victorious
overcomer! Yep, that's YOU!
