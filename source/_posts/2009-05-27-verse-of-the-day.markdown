_Mark 9:23  
Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible
to him that believeth._

Scott Hamilton, a gold medalist, said, /"The only disability in
life is a bad attitude."/ To be correct, we must say that not having
a personal relationship with Jesus Christ is the only disability in
life. It is out of that personal relationship that "all things are
made possible," if you believe. The question you are left with is,
"Do you believe?"
