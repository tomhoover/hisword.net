title: May 12th - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.

_Proverbs 23:17  
Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the
LORD all the day long._

A healthy relationship with the LORD will include respect or fear
of Him. The LORD does not want His children to be like sinners, who
live evil lives with no thought for tomorrow. As His children, we are
to be mindful of Him every day, ALL day long. The sinner is not to be
envied, as the LORD will deal with them. Keep YOUR heart on the LORD
all day long, and He will keep you!
