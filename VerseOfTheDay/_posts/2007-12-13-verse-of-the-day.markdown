_Romans 11:33  
O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!_

Are your pockets feeling empty? Think about the riches you have in
God. God has some "gifts" for you that you won't even know about till
you get to heaven. Isn't our God good? Tell everyone you see that "God
is good!"
