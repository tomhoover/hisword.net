_John 16:13  
Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he
shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to
come._

Do you ever find yourself in place where you just don't know what
to do about something? Glad you came by today, because our verse has
help for you. We are told that the Holy Spirit will guide you and
help you. How do you know for sure what the Holy Spirit is saying?
The Scriptures will agree with everything He says, and He will always
reveal truth in light of Jesus Christ. Get in the WORD, and listen to
the Spirit's direction!
