_Romans 15:1  
We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak,
and not to please ourselves._

If you consider yourself to be strong in comparison to other
Christians, use your strength to serve and help the weak instead of
using your strength just to please yourself. At the end of the day,
you will find that this is the formula for real happiness.
