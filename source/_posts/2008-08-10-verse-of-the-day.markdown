_Job 19:25  
For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the
latter day upon the earth._

It is a Christian&rsquo;s faith in God that makes him different
from other people. You can express your faith in God today by being
loving, patient, and long suffering with people. When you can smile
in the face of injustice, it&rsquo;s as if you are saying, &ldquo;I
know that my Redeemer liveth!!&rdquo;
