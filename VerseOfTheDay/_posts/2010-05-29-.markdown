title: May 29th - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.

_I Thessalonians 5:22  
Abstain from all appearance of evil._

There are some places, and people, that you just know you should
stay away from. Don't tempt yourself by even thinking about going
there. When those thoughts of evil come in your mind, cast them down.
There are other places or people that might be marginal, and you might
you think you are strong enough to handle this by yourself. Our verse
admonishes you to not trust in your own strength, but to stay away
from ALL EVIL.
