_Ephesians 6:4  
And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them
up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord._

Happy Father's Day! Fathers are called to be FAITHFUL to the Lord.
This means bringing your children to God's house and spending some
one on one time with children talking to them about God's love and
care for them. Why is it that fathers would rather provide for the
material needs over the spiritual needs of their children? God's role
for a father is that the child would learn directly and personally
about God through the head of the home.
