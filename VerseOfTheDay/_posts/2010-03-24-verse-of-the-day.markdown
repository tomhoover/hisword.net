_John 15:7  
If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye
will, and it shall be done unto you._

How's your prayer-life lately? There seems to be a direct
connection with a close relationship with the Lord and answered
prayer. It's not that God gives you everything you ask of Him in your
prayers, it's that you have a better knowledge of Him, His will, and
His ways. As you abide more with God, your relationship grows and you
find yourself wanting what He wants over your own selfish desires.
Time spent in prayer with your heavenly Father, is the most important
thing you will do today!
