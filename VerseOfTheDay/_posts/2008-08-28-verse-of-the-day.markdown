_II Thessalonians 3:3  
But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from
evil._

God is faithful to help you when you find yourself on &ldquo;shaky
ground&rdquo; or in unsure situations. If you aren&rsquo;t sure if
you should do something or not, ask for His wisdom. God will protect
you from evil, when you call upon Him.
