_Ecclesiastes 9:10  
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there
is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave,
whither thou goest._

You have only been given one life upon this earth! Every day is a
precious gift from God, and each morning you should purpose to do
your very best for God's glory, with the thought that this could be
your last day. Work while you can!
