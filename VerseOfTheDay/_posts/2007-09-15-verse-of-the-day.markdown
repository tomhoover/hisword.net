_Isaiah 26:3-4  
3 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee:
because he trusteth in thee.  
4 Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is
everlasting strength._

This perfect peace is not always felt, received, and enjoyed in the
soul; yet the foundation of it always is, and is always perfect, and
therefore, can always be felt, received and enjoyed. The percentage
of time that a Christian is enjoying this perfect peace in his/her
life is proportionate to his/her spiritual maturity level in Christ.
Appropriating this perfect peace as an ever-present reality in your
life is learned, as Paul said, "for I have learned, in whatsoever
state I am, therewith to be content" (Phil 4:11b).
