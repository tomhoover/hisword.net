_I Samuel 15:22  
And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings
and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey
is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams._

Are you celebrating "freedom" with family or friends today? Be
obedient to God's Word, and be sure to share the story of "freedom
from sin's condemnation" with your friends. As you see the firework
"lights" that explode in the sky, celebrate the "Truth" that sets all
men free!
