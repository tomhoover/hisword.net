_Psalm 91:4  
He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt
thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler._

When a summer storm suddenly appears and catches us outside, we run
for shelter to get out of the wind and rain. From the vantage point of
heaven, we look like little chicks, running under the protective wings
of a mother hen when they feel threatened. As God's children, we are
never without a place to run when we are threatened by the storms of
life! God's presence and promises are always near! Do you see Him?
