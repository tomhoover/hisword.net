_Ephesians 2:14  
For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down
the middle wall of partition between us._

Jesus brought peace of heart to the earth when He gave His life for
the sins of mankind. Have you made peace with Jesus? If you have given
your heart to Him and asked Him to forgive your sins, you have a peace
today that is better than anything else in this world. Smile, and show
off your peace today!
