_II Corinthians 2:14  
Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in
every place._

Someone observed that, "A smile is an inexpensive way to change
your looks." Smiles actually make people more attractive. Christians
have something to smile about every day of their lives. Christ has
won the victory over sin and the grave. Christian, do you have a
smile? It's an inexpensive gift that you can give to a lost world!
SMILE!
