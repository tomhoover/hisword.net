title: May 31st - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.
---

_I Peter 3:8-9  
Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another,
love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: Not rendering evil for
evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that
ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing._

Christian, you are called to live your life in a way that will
honor and glorify God. That means you are to have compassion for
those who exasperate you; be kind to those who mistreat you; and
speak words of blessing to those who say hateful things to you. How
in the world are you supposed to do such unnatural things? The answer
is found in the first part of our verse. "Be ye all of ONE MIND." If
you want to be like Jesus, you must embrace his Extreme love and not
think evil, but good!
