_Matthew 9:4  
And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in
your hearts?_

Our verse for today is very convicting. Most of the time we hide
our thoughts, especially the evil ones, from people. We don't stop to
think that we can't hide our thoughts from God. Imagine if your
thoughts were written above your head for all to read. Would you work
more at casting down those evil thoughts? Thank you God, for your
mercy in our lives, and help us not to embrace any thought that we
would not want to be made public.
