title: October 24th - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_Romans 15:4  
For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures
might have hope._

Have you ever had someone encourage you to be patient through their
example? God has recorded the lives of people who were impatient as
well as those who were patient in His Word, so that we might learn
from their lives. If they could do it, there's hope for you! If you
know someone who is struggling with a difficult situation in their
life, share the hope that only Christ can bring in our lives!
