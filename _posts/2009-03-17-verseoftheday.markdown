title: March 17th - Partnership with God to Touch Lives
---

_Micah 7:19  
He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue
our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of
the sea._

Well, it's that time again! There's not a day that goes by, but
what you need to ask forgiveness of your sins. God compassionately
forgives your sins, and He asks you to forgive those who offend you.
Your partner will help you forgive others, if you will take the first
step.
