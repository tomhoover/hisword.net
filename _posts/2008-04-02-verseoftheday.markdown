title: April 2nd - God&rsquo;s Place of Care
---

_Genesis 16:13  
And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God
seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth
me?_

In this Bible verse, Hagar realized that God did see and care about
her. She had thought she was forsaken and alone. Have you every
wondered where God was? Don&rsquo;t worry, He&rsquo;s there and He
has you in His watchful care.
