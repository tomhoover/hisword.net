_Psalm 96:6  
Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his
sanctuary._

You are blessed today to be able to go to His sanctuary and to
experience God&rsquo;s presence through worship. Don&rsquo;t leave
God&rsquo;s house without seeing His strength and beauty. It&rsquo;s
there if you have eyes that want to see.
