title: October 1st - The Basics of Partnership
---

_Romans 12:11  
Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord._

Throughout God's Word we are given attributes that God desires to
see in our lives as we work together with Him. Imagine that God is
sitting right beside you today as you work. Would you work harder and
stay more focused? Be sure that if you do your best in whatever is put
before you, God will be pleased.
