title: January 30th - Partnership with God in Daily Disciplines
---

_Psalm 17:3  
Thou hast proved mine heart; Thou hast visited me in the night; Thou
hast tried me, and shall find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth
shall not transgress._

Everyone needs to pray daily for God to help them know when and
what to say during the course of the day. If you don't, you could
find yourself having a sleepless night. It takes a disciplined person
to hold their tongue in the face of injustice. It takes God's help!
Call on Him!
