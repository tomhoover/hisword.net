title: August 2nd - God&rsquo;s Place of Faithfulness
---

_Hebrews 11:3  
Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word
of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which
do appear._

Evolution says that the earth evolved, or grew, out of a speck in
the universe. Where did the speck come from? The Bible tells us that
God started with nothing and through His words spoke everything into
existence. It is through faith, believing in what we cannot see, that
God is pleased. Do you believe? Then, live like it today!
