_Psalm 138:8  
The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O Lord,
endureth forever; forsake not the works of thine own hands._

Don't be discouraged! The mighty God that sits among the clouds is
watching and concerned about every part of your life. Be faithful to
God, He wants to make some wonderful changes in your life, if you
will but trust Him.
