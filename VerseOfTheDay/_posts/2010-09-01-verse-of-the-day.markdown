title: September 1st - Extreme Love...endures through trials.
---

_I Corinthians 13:7d  
...endureth all things._

Corrie Ten Boom, a survivor of the Holocaust, said, "If God sends
us on strong paths, we are provided strong shoes." If God allows
trials in your life, He will help you endure them. Many survive the
trials, but will they still have LOVE in their heart when it's over?
God is the only one who can provide you with that kind of EXTREME
LOVE! Call upon Him now, no matter how small or large your trial. Ask
for loving endurance for your journey of life.
