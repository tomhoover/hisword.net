_Psalm 119:60  
I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments._

God is talking to His children all the time about doing things for
others. It's not that we don't want to do it, it's just that we get
too busy doing other things. This is not the day to put off doing
God's work. Get busy! God's got some work for you today! Send a card.
Make a phone call. Share a smile. Tell someone about Jesus. Touch
another life!
