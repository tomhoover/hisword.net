_Isaiah 26:4  
Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is
everlasting strength._

Get ready for a wonderful day! There is no one on earth who has the
strength to perform mighty deeds in your life, like our God. When you
trust Him with your life, He will give you His best! Watch for His
blessings today!
