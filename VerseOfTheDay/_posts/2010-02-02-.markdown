title: February 2nd - Extreme Love...is gracious, not rude.
---

_Psalm 111:4  
He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is
gracious and full of compassion._

It's Groundhog day! Will you be living the rest of your life like
you are now? Are you growing in love and compassion every day, or are
you at a "stand still?" The Lord puts reminders of His grace and
compassion before you every day of your life. If you are breathing
today, it's because of His grace. If the planet earth is held in
perfect orbit today, it's because of His grace. If you have food to
eat today, it's because of His grace. Best yet, if your sins have
been forgiven, it's because of His grace. Break out of your "rut of
indifference," and show more grace and compassion to others, today!
