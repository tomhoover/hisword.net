_Psalm 136:7-9  
7 To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever:  
8 The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:  
9 The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for
ever._

"He made the stars also." This is all that is said in Genesis
concerning the creation of the stars. Miracles and magnificence are
commonplace with God. Our concerns, needs and desires are no problem
with God. The same God, in Jesus Christ, who can reach the stars, can
easily reach into the depths of your spirit to guide and direct your
life for His purposes, in His time. Every star is unique, and every
person, especially you, are uniquely created by God for His glory.
