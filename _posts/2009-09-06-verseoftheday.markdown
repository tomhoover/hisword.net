_Psalm 27:4  
One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I
may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold
the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple._

What would you do without Sundays? If there was no day set aside to
worship God, every day of the week would be the same. It would be a
meaningless existence. There is nothing that can lift your spirits
more than, meeting with God's people, hearing His words, and thanking
your Creator for all your blessings, on His day. Is this the "one
thing" that you desire most?
