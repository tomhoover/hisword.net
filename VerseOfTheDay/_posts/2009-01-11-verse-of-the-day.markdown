_Deuteronomy 30:14  
But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart,
that thou mayest do it._

Some people say they are going to do something, and they never
follow through with their words. If you have put your whole heart
into doing something, it will be more than just words. A real love
for God will find you reading your Bible, and searching for "Words of
Life" that will impact your day.
