title: August 18th - Extreme Love...hopes and believes the best.
---

_Psalm 42:8  
Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in
the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my
life._

HOPE shows up in the dark and breaks through with the dawning of a
new day. It starts as a song and prayer in the night, and becomes an
awareness of God's lovingkindness by morning light. Don't dwell in
the dark, walk in the LIGHT of His presence today!
