_Acts 6:8  
And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles
among the people._

According to our verse, there is a state of "fullness" when it
comes to FAITH. Unfortunately, it's like eating a meal. When we push
back from the table, we are FULL, but several hours later, we need to
eat again! That tells us something about our own FAITH. It must be
fed. There is no substitute for prayer and God's Word in the life of
a Christian. If you want to be FULL of FAITH, you will have to do
your part. The wonderful thing about prayer is that you can talk to
God constantly throughout your day, and be filled with His presence.
Are you FULL?
