_I Timothy 4:10  
For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in
the living God, who is the Savior of all men, specially of those that
believe._

There is no vacation when it comes to serving God. God asks you to
work and to be willing to suffer for Him every day, so that others
can know Him. What can you do today to point someone to a faith in
Jesus Christ?
