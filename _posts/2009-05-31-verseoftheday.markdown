_Psalm 13:6  
I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with
me._

Some days you may not think you have a song in your heart, sing
anyway! Before long the sunshine will come out and you will be able
to see God's blessings in your life. As you turn your face to the
SON, the shadows will fall behind you. l
