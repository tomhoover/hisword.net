_Hebrews 13:20  
Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord
Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the
everlasting covenant._

Our Lord Jesus is the Great Shepherd of His sheep because, He made
the eternal sacrifice of His blood which cleanses and covers our sin
forever, which is why it is the "blood of the everlasting covenant."
God&rsquo;s promise to all people is that of they will turn from
their sin and believe on the sacrifice of His Son for the forgiveness
of their sin, they will have a place in heaven for eternity which can
never be taken from them. This is the eternal security that the Bible
proclaims in spite of preachers and teachers who are bent on rejecting
it.
