title: March 29th - Partnership with God to Touch Lives
---

_Ephesians 2:8-9  
8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves: it is the gift of God:  
9 Not of works, lest any man should boast._

As you live your life for God today, ask God to give you an
opportunity to share this verse with someone. This is God's gift, not
yours. He will provide an opportunity, and touch a life, if you will
take the challenge to share His Word.
