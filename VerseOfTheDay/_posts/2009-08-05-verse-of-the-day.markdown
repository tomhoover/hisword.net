_Ephesians 6:11  
Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against
the wiles of the devil._

Did you wake up this morning thinking about what you were going to
wear? If you want to live your life pleasing to God today, be sure to
put on God's armor. If you haven't prepared yourself through prayer,
you will be vulnerable to the devil's attacks. He wants to keep you
from becoming more like Christ. Better put on your armor!
