_Titus 3:5  
Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to
His mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing
of the Holy Ghost._

Where would you be today were it not for God? Anything good in your
life is because of God&rsquo;s involvement. Take a moment to thank God
for delivering you from your former life, and giving you a purpose for
living!
