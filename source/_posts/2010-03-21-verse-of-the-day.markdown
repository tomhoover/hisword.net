_Psalm 75:1  
Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks:
for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare._

Have you ever noticed that most artists sign their portraits? They
want everyone to know that it is their work. Our verse tells us that
God's name is near all His marvelous works. Even though His name
isn't written in the beautiful sunrise, all must know that such
precision of color and design, has a Creator and such beauty couldn't
be an accident. God's name has been written all over your life. Do you
see it? Give the Artist of your life, a word of thanks. He deserves
it!
