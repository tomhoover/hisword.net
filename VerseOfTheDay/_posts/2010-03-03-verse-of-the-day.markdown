_Proverbs 25:21-22  
If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be
thirsty, give him water to drink: For thou shalt heap coals of fire
upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee._

Is there someone in your life that you are having problems loving?
While you can only work on your side of the problem, our verse
reminds us that when you "give," you have totally changed the
equation. When your heart is tender enough to give up your pride, you
have put the ball in the other person's court, and the Lord will
reward you! Anyway you do the math, when you "give," God gets the
glory and you become a winner.
