title: December 7th - Partnership with God in Personal Finances

_II Thessalonians 3:10  
For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any
would not work, neither should he eat._

Now there's a great diet plan for the Christmas season! Work if you
want to eat! Everyone needs to pull their share of the work load. When
you have God as your partner, He makes work an enjoyable experience.
Smile!
