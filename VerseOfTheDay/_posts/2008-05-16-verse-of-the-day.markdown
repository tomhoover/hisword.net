_Isaiah 51:11  
Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with
singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they
shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee
away._

Find the good in your life today and praise it! Anybody can be
happy when things are going right. Christians are reminded that joy
doesn&rsquo;t come from circumstances, but it comes from a constant
faithful relationship with the Heavenly Father. If you have Jesus,
you have the best!
