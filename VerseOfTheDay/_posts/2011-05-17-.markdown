_I Thessalonians 2:4  
But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel,
even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our
hearts._

Just a reminder: You were not put on earth to PLEASE people! You
were put on earth to PLEASE God! He's searching for FAITH Full hearts
today! Who will you strive to PLEASE today? Tell someone about
JESUS!
