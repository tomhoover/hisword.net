_Psalm 91:14  
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him:
I will set him on high, because he hath known my name._

Everyone knows, if not by experience, by the testimonies of others,
not to get between a mama bear and her cub! Family members who love
each other, watch out for one another! It is the same with those who
know and love the Lord. When you love the Lord and put your trust in
Him, you are given a promise of His protection and care for you. May
the confidence of this promise color your day with peace and
happiness. EXTREME LOVE!
