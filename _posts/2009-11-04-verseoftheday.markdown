title: November 4th - Extreme Love...Is Kind
---

_Psalm 31:21  
Blessed be the LORD: for he hath showed me his marvelous kindness in
a strong city._

Living in the midst of a big impersonal city, kindness can be hard
to find. When you do small acts of kindness for others, it will stand
out like a light in a dark room. The motive for your kindness is that
the LORD would be glorified. Do an act of kindness for someone in
your city, today, and be sure that the LORD gets the credit! It will
make for a sunny day!
