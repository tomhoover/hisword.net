_Amos 8:11  
Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine
in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of
hearing the words of the LORD._

There is a "thirst" in our world for truth and genuine purpose in
life! Many have never read God's WORD. They don't know that the
answers to their greatest longing in life are found in the WORDS of
this book. You know all those extra Bibles in your house. Would you
take a minute and go get one, and purpose to give it to someone
today? You could leave it in a public place or hand it to a needy
face! Share God's LIVING WATER!
