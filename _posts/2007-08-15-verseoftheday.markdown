_II Corinthians 9:8  
And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye,
always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good
work._

This speaks of the wisdom in recognizing the severe limitations of
man, in his own ability and resources, against the inexhaustible
supply of the grace of God actively working in your life as a
believer trusting Christ in all things. By this sufficiency it is
meant that all goodness, beneficence, and liberality exercised
towards the poorest members of Christ, who yet give liberally and
generously, God is able, and He will, and it ought to be believed
that He will, cause to return with an increase, all that which is
expended in relieving the necessities of the saints.
