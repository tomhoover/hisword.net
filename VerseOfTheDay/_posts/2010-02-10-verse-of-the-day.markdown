title: February 10th - Extreme Love...is gracious, not rude.
---

_Romans 13:8  
Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth
another hath fulfilled the law._

If you are a Christian, the debt of love that you owe to God will
never be paid in full. You will forever be indebted to God, and He
requests that what you owe Him be paid back through an investment of
love in the lives of others. Just when you thought you were getting
your finances in order, you come to understand that you will forever
owe LOVE to mankind! This is one debt you must pay every day of your
life!
