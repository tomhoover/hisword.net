_Matthew 9:22  
But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter,
be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was
made whole from that hour._

All of the miracles in the Bible had one common element. It was
FAITH! FAITH in God! Could that be the reason that there are fewer
miracles in the lives of people upon this earth today? Absolute FAITH
has been replaced with "maybe He will" in the lives of many. Satan
wants us to think that God's miracles were limited to Bible days.
Christian, God is still doing miracles for those who are FULL of
FAITH!
