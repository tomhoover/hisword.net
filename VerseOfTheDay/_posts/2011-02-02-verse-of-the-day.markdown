_I Timothy 6:12  
Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto
thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before
many witnesses._

The first word in our verse describes the mind set that Christians
need if they are to maintain their FAITH. The word is "fight!" If you
are to stay focused on God's objectives for your life, it will call
for a willingness on your part to do battle against apathy,
indifference, and the enticements of this world. You must work at
staying close to your Savior, because this verse reminds you that
there are many witnesses who are watching your life! Your FAITH is
important! Fight to keep it strong!
