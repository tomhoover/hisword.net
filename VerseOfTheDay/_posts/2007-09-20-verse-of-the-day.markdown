_Psalm 16:11  
Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of
joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore._

To Jesus first this way was shown, for he is the first-begotten
from the dead, the first-born of every creature. He himself opened up
the way through his own flesh, and then trod it as the forerunner of
his own redeemed. The thought of being made the path of life to his
people, gladdened the soul of Jesus. -Treasury of Knowledge
