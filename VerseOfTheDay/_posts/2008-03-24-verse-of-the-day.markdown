title: March 24th - God&rsquo;s Place of Promise
---

_John 11:25-26  
25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that
believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:  
26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
Believest thou this?_

God speaks to those who want to listen to Him. Did you hear him? Do
you believe in Him? Those who believe in Him are alive forevermore!
It&rsquo;s a promise you can take to the bank!
