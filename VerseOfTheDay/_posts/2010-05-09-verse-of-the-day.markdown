title: May 9th - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.

_Proverbs 31:26  
She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of
kindness._

It would be wonderful, if every time you opened your mouth, kind
words came out. There will always be a struggle for this to happen as
long as you live on earth. God can elevate your thinking if you will
ask Him to help you. Thinking precedes actions and deeds. May you
download God's wisdom and apply it to your life today.
