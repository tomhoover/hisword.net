title: June 4th - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith
---

_Psalm 90:1  
Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations._

How precious and miraculous is the truth that God dwells inside
those who have asked Him into their heart. The houses, that previous
generations lived in, have for the most part fallen apart or been
destroyed through time. God instead, has faithfully chosen to dwell
inside believers from generation to generation, outlasting all man
made dwellings. God is with you! Be faithful to Him today!
