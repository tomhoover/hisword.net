title: July 3rd - God&rsquo;s Place of Salvation
---

_Psalm 68:19  
Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the
God of our salvation. Selah._

It&rsquo;s that time again! It&rsquo;s time to count your
blessings! Stop, and quickly think of three blessings that you have
already experienced today! Imagine how many more you will have before
this day is over. You can&rsquo;t afford not to stop and praise God,
when you are so blessed!
