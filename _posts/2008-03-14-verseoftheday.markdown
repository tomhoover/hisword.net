title: March 14th - God&rsquo;s Place of Promise
---

_II Corinthians 5:21  
For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we
might be made the righteousness of God in him._

Some day we will sit around heaven&rsquo;s throne and see our God
face to face. The wonder that He would love us so much will be even
greater then, than it is now. Jesus left the magnificence of heaven
for you. Will you sacrifice something for Him today?
