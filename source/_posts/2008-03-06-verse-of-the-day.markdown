_Hebrews 6:10  
For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love,
which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to
the saints, and do minister._

Purpose to show God&rsquo;s love and do a kind deed in His name to
as many people as you can today. God promises to be watching and
reward you accordingly.
