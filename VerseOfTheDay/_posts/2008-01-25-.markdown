title: January 25th - God's Place of Power
---

_Hebrews 1:3  
Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his
person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he
had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the
Majesty on high._

Hold your head up high today! You have a Friend in High Places, who
gave His life for you. Let His glory show up on your face. That will
make you smile all day!
