title: December 21st - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_Jeremiah 6:13a  
For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one
is given to covetousness._

Charles L. Allen, in _The Miracle of Love_ writes of a fisherman
friend who told him that one never needs a top for his crab basket.
If one of the crabs starts to climb up the sides of the basket, the
other crabs will reach up and pull it back down. Some people are a
lot like crabs, they can't let anyone get ahead of them. Don't be a
crab, be joyful with what God gives you!
