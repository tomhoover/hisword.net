_Romans 8:37  
Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him
that loved us._

Our verse encourages us to have the mind set of victory before the
battle and in the midst of the battle. This is a conquering FAITH!
With God's POWER you are more than conquerors, as the battle belongs
to the LORD! You don't wait until things look favorable, to declare
victory! You declare victory now, while the arrows are flying! FAITH
is more than being on the winning side one day, it's living and
acting like you have already won the battle now! This attitude will
LIFT your FAITH to a new level!
