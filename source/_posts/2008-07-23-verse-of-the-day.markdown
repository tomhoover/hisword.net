_Psalm 28:7  
The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in Him, and
I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song I
will praise Him._

If God has been good to you, rejoice and praise Him with a song!
God wants to hear YOUR praise! Nobody else can express your praise
for you. God is looking down at you, longing for you to look up and
acknowledge His presence. Praise Him with your heart and voice!
He&rsquo;s waiting.
