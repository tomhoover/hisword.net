title: September 3rd - Extreme Love...endures through trials.
---

_II Corinthians 12:9-10  
And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for my
strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I
rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest
upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in distresses for
Christ&rsquo;s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong._

In some ways, it seems strange that we can only become strong if we
are weak. God can't fill you with His EXTREME LOVE if you are full of
yourself. You can only be filled when you are empty of yourself. This
empty point in life is when you realize that the trials of life are
really a wonderful thing, because they open you up to the
availability of God's power in your life. You would never know the
power of God, were it not for difficult times. Praise God for His
knowing what you need! It's called LOVE!
