_Psalm 72:17  
His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long
as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call
him blessed._

Abraham was known as the &ldquo;friend of God&rdquo;, and God
promised to bless the nations through Him. Is God your friend? Do you
want to blessed? Spend some time talking to God.
