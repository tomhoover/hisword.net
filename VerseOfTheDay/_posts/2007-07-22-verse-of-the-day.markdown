_Revelation 21:23  
And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine
in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light
thereof._

God&rsquo;s revelation to man begins with God's light ("Let there
be light" - Gen. 1:3), and here in Revelation the Glory of God
illuminates the heavenly city of God. There is literally no need for
the sun. If the sun and moon did shine, they would give no added
light in the presence of the Glory of God. In the Lamb light is
concentrated, and from Him it is everywhere diffused.
