title: October 10th - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_I Thessalonians 5:14  
Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the
feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men._

Take a moment and put some names with the people described in our
verse. Do you know someone who is unruly or disrespectful? Do you
know someone who doesn't have good common sense? Do you know someone
who is always needing the help of others to get anything done? As you
put names to each of these people, ask God to help you to be patient
and understanding of their needs, and to use you to show them God's
Extreme LOVE.
