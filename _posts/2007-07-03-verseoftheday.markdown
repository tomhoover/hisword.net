_II Corinthians 4:6  
For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath
shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory
of God in the face of Jesus Christ._

Imagine a video camera zoomed all the way out to the widest angle
revealing every face in the room. Now imagine zooming in tight to
only one face, with nothing or no one else in view. This is the
essence of the exhortation of Paul. Zoom in and focus on Jesus so
intently that the people and problems that once distracted you are no
longer in your spiritual field of view, for in His wonderful face is
the vision of the "light of the knowledge of the glory of God."
