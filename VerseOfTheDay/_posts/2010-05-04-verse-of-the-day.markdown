_I John 1:9  
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness._

It's good to start each morning off with a "clean slate" by asking
God to forgive your sins. Everyone enjoys the clean smell that comes
after the rain. This same cleansing is needed in your life if your
life is to be a sweet smelling sacrifice to Him. Ask God to cleanse
your heart from anything that would hinder your fellowship with
Him.
