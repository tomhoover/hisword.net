_John 16:27  
For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and
have believed that I came out from God._

Do you believe? Do you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?
Do you believe that He died for your sins, and have you asked Him into
your heart? That is the most important decision in your life. If you
can trust God with your eternity, you can surely trust Him with your
present circumstances, if you believe? EXTREME LOVE believes the
BEST!
