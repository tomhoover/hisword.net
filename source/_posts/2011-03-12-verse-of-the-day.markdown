_Hebrews 11:17  
By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that
had received the promises offered up his only begotten son._

Has God ever tried you? If you have given your heart and life to
Him, you have been put on God's Faith Tried list. FAITH that is not
tried, becomes weak and ineffective. Abraham passed the test on this
occasion, but he had failed several tests before this. Sometimes it
might seem you are tested to your limits, but God is looking for
obedience and trust.! God wants to know, "Will ________ obey and
trust Me today?" Would you put your name in that blank? FAITH!
