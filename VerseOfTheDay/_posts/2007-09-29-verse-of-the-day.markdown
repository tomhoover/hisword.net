_Psalm 90:1-2  
1 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.  
2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed
the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou
art God._

The mountains and hills appear to man to have been everlasting; but
as they were brought forth out of the womb of eternity, there was a
time when they were not. We serve the God that has been from the
eternity that is past, before time for man began; to the eternity
that is after, when time shall be no more. All people, in all
cultures, in all times, can recognize this truth, and it leads
straight to Christ!
