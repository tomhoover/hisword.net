_I John 3:18  
My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but
in deed and in truth._

It's one thing to say you love someone, but it is another thing to
"get up" and follow through with your intentions. Is there anyone in
your life for which you have been saying, "Someday, I&rsquo;m going
to go see _______?" "Someday, I'm going to send ________a card."
"Someday, I'm going to tell ______ about Jesus?" You fill in the
blank, and don't just talk about it. Do it!
