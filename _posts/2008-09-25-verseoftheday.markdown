title: September 25th - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Psalm 94:18  
When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up._

Mercy is exercised only where there is guilt involved. When you
break a traffic law, you can expect to come before a judge and pay a
ticket. When you break God's laws and ask His forgiveness, in mercy,
He erases your sin, and wipes it off your record. Thank God for His
mercy, in not giving you what you deserve.
