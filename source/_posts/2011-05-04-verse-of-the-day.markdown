_II Corinthians 4:17  
For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us
a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory._

In the midst of life's trials, your problems can seem to be HUGE,
not light, small, or brief! How can you think of your problems as
being small? You are asked to compare your time upon this earth, in
contrast to a future: perfect, endless, eternity spent with God! You
have been given just a short time (a moment) upon this earth, to
glorify God. Are you thinking about the "now" or "eternity?" This
verse calls for a continual attitude adjustment in the life of every
believer!
