_Hebrews 11:23  
By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his
parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not
afraid of the king's commandment._

The average Christian today, will not go against the tenets of
their culture. They don't think that one voice in the midst of this
vocal majority could make any difference. That's where our verse
today gives us some encouragement. God used one man, Moses, to lead a
nation out of bondage. If his parents hadn't risked their own lives,
it wouldn't have happened. You are living at a time when your voice
is more important than ever! Don't be an average Christian! Today,
may you be that one person, who is FULL of FAITH, standing up for
God/s commandments and leading the way for those who come behind
you.
