_Matthew 7:7  
Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and
it shall be opened unto you._

All three of these verbs, ask-seek-knock express intensity and
urgency regarding the thing sought after. When you really want
something, you earnestly strive for it. When the Christian is seeking
something, anything, within the scope of the will of the Lord, he/she
will have it if they ask-seek-knock.
