_Psalm 27:5  
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the
secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a
rock._

Trouble knocks on all our doors from time to time. If your life is
built upon the ROCK, the enemy will eventually leave with bruised
knuckles.
