_Philemon 4-5  
4 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,  
5 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord
Jesus, and toward all saints._

Here is a rather wealthy man, recently saved, who is seeking and
trusting God in Christ instead of his position or possessions.
Philemon has come to be known for his great love for God and his
fellow believers as well as his example of faith. Biblical love and
faith, sincerely applied, will always work itself out of your heart
and into the lives of your fellow believers, especially in a church
setting, strengthening and encouraging the brethren. Are you a
Philemon?
