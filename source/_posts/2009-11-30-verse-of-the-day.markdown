_Psalm 40:10  
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared
thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy
lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation._

Undercover Christians try to blend in with the world and be like
everyone else. It has been said that "In this world of EXTREMES, you
can only love too little." If a Christian will love to the EXTREME,
love when no one else will, the power and truth of God's love will be
revealed! Will you dare to be known as a Christian?
Will they know you are a Christian by your love and kindness?
