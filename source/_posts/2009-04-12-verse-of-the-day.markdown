_I Corinthians 15:20  
But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of
them that slept._

HE&rsquo;S ALIVE!!!!!!! Jesus is alive! He did what no one else on
earth had ever done, when He rose from the grave! You have a Partner
to be beside you all the days of your life, because He's alive! Be
happy and celebrate eternal life through Jesus Christ our Savior!
Live like He's alive!
