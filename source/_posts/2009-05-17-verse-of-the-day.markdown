_I Peter 3:4  
But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not
corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is
in the sight of God of great price._

When people greet you today, what is the first thing they will
notice? Will they notice what you are wearing outwardly before they
see your expressions and hear your greeting? Will your humble, yet
warm spirit, come through in your voice and expressions? God puts
great value upon the heart. If your heart is full of God's love, it
will have the loudest voice in your life, and it will show up on your
face.
