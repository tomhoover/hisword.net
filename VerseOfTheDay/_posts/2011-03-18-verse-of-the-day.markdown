_Hebrews 11:27  
By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he
endured, as seeing him who is invisible._

This is a powerful verse! Moses had to make a decision. Would he
fear man, who could destroy him, or trust God? It wasn't just Moses
who would die, but all those he was leading. The difference in Moses
and most of us, was his vision! In his mind he could see God going
with them. He left no space for doubt! God was with him! It is this
same vision that will secure the child of God today! Leave no space
for doubt! Envision God's arms around you, and walk in the power
delivered through FAITH!
