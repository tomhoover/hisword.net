title: June 29th - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith
---

_Psalm 125:1-2  
1 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot
be removed, but abideth for ever.  
2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round
about his people from henceforth even for ever._

When you put God in the very center of your life, you are as secure
as Mount Zion, which no one can move! God is the Rock. He doesn't
change. You are the one who changes. Ask God to keep your FAITH
strong and unchanging against the trials and uncertainties of life.
May your FAITH be strong as a mountain today, and an encouragement to
those on the plains!
