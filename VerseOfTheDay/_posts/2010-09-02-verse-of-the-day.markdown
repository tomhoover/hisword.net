title: September 2nd - Extreme Love...endures through trials.
---

_I Peter 1:7-8a  
That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold
that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto
praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ; Whom
having not seen, ye love._

Are you serving the Lord out of "love" or out of "duty?" This can
be easily determined by examining your heart after you have gone
through a trial. If you can still praise the Lord and give Him honor,
chances are your focus was on "love for Christ," not "duty." Praise
offered after a trial is more precious to God than gold! Christian,
LOVE your LORD no matter what you are facing, as the LORD is with you
and loves you!
