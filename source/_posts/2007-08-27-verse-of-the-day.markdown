_II Corinthians 1:5  
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation
also aboundeth by Christ._

The Greek word for "abound" here literally means to super abound,
to excel excessively! We experience the superabundance of God&rsquo;s
amazing comfort, well beyond the norm, when we suffer for Christ,
either by trials from God (health, etc.) or by tribulation from the
world. Jesus said we must count the cost of being a disciple. Cost
implies that surrender of our life to Christ involves sacrifice of
both our lives and our wills; but the superabundant consolation of
God that accompanies it is a windfall return on the investment of our
lives in Christ.
