title: February 13th - God's Place of Presence
---

_Psalm 42:8  
Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in
the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my
life._

The song that God sings to you in the night can be carried with you
into the day also. It will go like this: "Amazing Grace, how sweet the
sound that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I&rsquo;m
found, was blind, but now I see." Share God's song with your world
today.
