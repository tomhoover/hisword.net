title: June 7th - Extreme Love...rejoices in truth.

_Proverbs 3:3  
Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck;
write them upon the table of thine heart._

Did you take time to put on your accessories today? According to
our verse, everyone should be wearing MERCY and TRUTH. If you are
wearing them upon your heart, they will show up in two ways. MERCY
shows up when your feelings change toward those who are unworthy of
compassion and understanding. TRUTH is revealed in your actions, when
you actually find yourself obeying God's command to embrace those who
have mistreated you. Ask God to give you a proper balance of both in
your life. It's the Christian accessory that makes you attractive in
God's eyes!
