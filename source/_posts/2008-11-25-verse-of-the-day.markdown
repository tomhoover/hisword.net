_Ephesians 1:3  
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in
Christ._

It's just a few more days until Thanksgiving. You can get so busy
with preparations that you can forget that it's all about giving
thanks to our awesome God! Take time today to prepare your heart
through prayer. Try to spend the next five minutes in prayer to God,
and don't ask Him for anything, but instead praise and thank Him for
all your blessings! You will enjoy life more, and you will be better
for the time spent with God.
