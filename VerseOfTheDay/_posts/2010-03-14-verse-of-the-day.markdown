_Psalm 29:2  
Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in
the beauty of holiness._

As is the case among most of us, we can find ourselves far too busy
to worship God and see the beauty of His holiness in our lives. We can
get caught up in the outward activities of going to church and forget
to focus on Him. Prepare your heart before you go to His house today,
and ask God to fill your soul and speak to you. Blessed be the name of
the Lord!
