title: May 11th - Partnership with God in Attitude and Mind-Set
---

_Matthew 6:25  
Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye
shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye
shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than
raiment?_

It isn't what you have that makes you happy, but your attitude
toward what you have that makes you happy. If you find yourself
always wanting more and worrying about getting more, ask God to help
you change your attitude. There is more to life than numbers and
possessions. The all wise God has given you what you need. Seize the
attitude and change your day!
