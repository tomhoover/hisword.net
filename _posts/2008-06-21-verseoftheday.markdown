title: June 21st - God&rsquo;s Place of Peace
---

_Psalm 29:11  
The Lord will give strength unto His people; the Lord will bless His
people with peace._

Do you need a promise that really will help you today? If you are
God&rsquo;s child, He will give you strength and peace today. You
might not have a perfect day in man&rsquo;s eyes, but if your focus
and prayers are unto God, He will help you and bless you with
peace.
