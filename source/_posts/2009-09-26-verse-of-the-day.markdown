_Colossians 1:18  
And he is the head of the body, the church; who is the beginning,
the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the
pre-eminence._

The most important thing you do at church is to give Jesus Christ
His place. It's all about HIM, not you! Prepare your heart now, for
services tomorrow. Will you see Jesus as you sing about His cross?
Will you connect with Jesus as your pastor speaks? Will you give
Jesus His place in your life?
