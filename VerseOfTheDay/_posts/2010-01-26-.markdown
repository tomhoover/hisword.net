_II Corinthians 4:7  
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of
the power may be of God, and not of us._

It may seem that you are living your life in your own strength, but
the power for every Christian to have an overcoming life comes from
God. Why does God put such a great treasure in such weak vessels? So
that the greatness of the power may be of God, and not us. Earthen
vessels reveal that we are of ourselves, nothing. It is only when
God's power is in our lives that we can become a treasure. Celebrate
God's overcoming power in your and share the treasure of "eternal
life" with someone today.
