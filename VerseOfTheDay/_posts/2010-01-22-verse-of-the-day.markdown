_Ecclesiastes 6:7  
All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not
filled._

If you are working on a New Year's resolution to lose some weight,
this is a good verse to reinforce your resolve. Whether it's your
appetite for food, possessions, or fame, it will never be satisfied
apart from Jesus Christ. He alone satisfies the cravings of your soul
when He gives you purpose for living. During your mealtimes today,
think about the eternal satisfaction that Jesus Christ brings into
your life, and skip dessert.
