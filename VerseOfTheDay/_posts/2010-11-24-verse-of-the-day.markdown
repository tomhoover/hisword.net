_Hebrews 13:15  
Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with
such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee,
nor forsake thee._

This verse is very convicting for everyone who's ever had a "pity
party!" Everyone has had one, whether you sent out invitations to
others or not. You can feel like you are missing out on the "great"
things in life, or you can just feel like you are all alone! If you
don't check that attitude, you will express it in your actions and
words. This attitude is the same one that Satan used on Eve in the
Garden. Satan is the host of the "pity party!" Christian, wise up and
throw a party to celebrate God constant provision and presence in your
life!
