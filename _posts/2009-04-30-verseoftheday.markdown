title: April 30th - Partnership with God for a Victorious Life
---

_Psalm 73:24  
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to
glory._

If you are a believer, God has promised to guide your every step,
until you are taken to heaven, if you will seek and heed His counsel.
By the time you reach the end of life, you will have hopefully learned
a few lessons. The most important lesson that all of us will learn is,
that God's faithful way was better than ours. Be wise today, and seek
His face and counsel.
