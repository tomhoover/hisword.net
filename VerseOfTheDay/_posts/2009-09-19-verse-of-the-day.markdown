_Ephesians 2:21-22  
21 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an
holy temple in the Lord:  
22 In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God
through the Spirit._

The keyword for today is "together." Be focused on working with
others to accomplish a common goal. At work, more things can be
accomplished when you are a "team player." It's the same in God's
churches. Christians need to lay aside their personal goals at times
to accomplish a greater goal on behalf of their church.
