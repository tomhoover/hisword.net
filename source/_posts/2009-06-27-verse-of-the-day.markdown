_Psalm 64:10  
The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and shall trust in Him, and
all the upright in heart shall glory._

Being "right with God" is mentioned twice in this short verse. Is
God talking to you about something you need to set "right" in your
life? God does things with purpose. There are no accidents with Him.
Restore the joy of your FAITH and praise God today!
