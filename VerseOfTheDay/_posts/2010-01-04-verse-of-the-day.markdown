title: January 4th - Extreme Love...Is not proud or self-focused
---

_Philippians 2:3  
Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of
mind let each esteem other better than themselves._

A lot of our problems in life could be solved if we would but ask
ourselves, "What's really important in this situation? Is it
important for me to look good, or for God to be glorified?" When we
get a proper view of ourselves, and elevate God and the concerns of
others, most conflicts can be resolved. Ask God to help you confront
any pride in your life that might be hindering or hurting
relationships in your life.
