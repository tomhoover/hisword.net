_Psalm 4:7-8  
7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that
their corn and their wine increased.  
8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only
makest me dwell in safety._

The source of "gladness" (glee) and "peace" is not monetary
prosperity or human security, but the LORD. When a child of God grows
to the point where the LORD is his portion and protection, he/she
experiences a gladness and peace that this world&rsquo;s ways can
never produce. Both the Father and the Son, through the Spirit desire
to make their abode with you (John 14:21-23). Will you let them in?
