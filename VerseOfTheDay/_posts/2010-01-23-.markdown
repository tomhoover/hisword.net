title: January 23rd - Extreme Love...Is not proud or self-focused
---

_Matthew 5:46  
For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even
the publicans the same?_

You know that person in your life to whom you have continued to
show love and they seem indifferent? Keep trying. Remember love never
fails! Love does make a difference in the life of others ,and it is
probably the most important thing you will do during this whole day.
Therefore show the LOVE of God faithfully every day!
