_John 1:17  
For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus
Christ._

Aren't you glad that you don't have to be perfect? The laws that
are given to us in God's Word are there to show us how imperfect we
are, not to condemn us. When Jesus Christ came and died for the sins
of mankind, GRACE and TRUTH made a way for us to be acceptable in
God's eyes. Because of the grace of Jesus Christ, you don't have to
be perfect, but you do have to be forgiven! Celebrate a loving God
who sees your heart, not your imperfections!
