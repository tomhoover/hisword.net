_Psalm 139:23  
Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts._

There are times when we cannot trust our own hearts. It is at those
times that you must ask God to look inside your heart and show you the
truth, that your own evil conscience is denying. The truth can set you
free.
