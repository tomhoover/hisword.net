_II Timothy 4:7  
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept
the faith._

"I am a soldier, and I do not need to be pampered, petted, primed
up, pumped up, picked up, or pepped up. I am a soldier and I'm
committed. I cannot have my feelings hurt badly enough or be
discouraged enough to turn me around. FAITH, prayer, and the WORD are
my weapons of warfare. I will either retire from this army at the
rapture, or die in this army; but I will not get out, sell out, be
talked out or pushed out. I am FAITH FULL, reliable and dependable. I
am a soldier in the army of MY GOD, the commander and invincible FORCE
of heaven." - Are you THAT soldier?
