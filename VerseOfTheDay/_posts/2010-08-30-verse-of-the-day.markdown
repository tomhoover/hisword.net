title: August 30th - Extreme Love...hopes and believes the best.
---

_Romans 8:38-39  
For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
Lord._

Do you believe this verse? It says that there is nothing in this
present world that can separate you from the EXTREME LOVE of God once
you've given your heart to Jesus! That means that neither death, nor
all the people, problems, evils, or concerns of this present life,
will be able to change God's love for you. WOW! If you believe this
verse, it should make a HUGE difference in your attitude and outlook,
today! SMILE!
