_I Timothy 3:15  
But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to
behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living
God, the pillar and ground of the truth._

A pillar is made to support and hold up something. In our verse,
the church, or the people in the church, are called to hold up and
keep the TRUTH. Christians support the church as a whole by
attending, giving, and serving. They also have an obligation to stay
grounded in the true doctrines laid down in the Word of God. Did
TRUTH visit your church today? Are you a supporting pillar in your
church?
