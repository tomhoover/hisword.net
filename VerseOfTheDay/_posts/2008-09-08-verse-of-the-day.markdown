_Psalm 86:5  
For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in
mercy unto all them that call upon thee._

Prayer opens the windows of heaven, from which God's mercy flows.
You can be confident that if you ask God's forgiveness, He will
forgive. It is only when you humble yourself before God, that you
will be able to see God's goodness and blessing upon your life. God's
mercy is still flowing, do you see it?
