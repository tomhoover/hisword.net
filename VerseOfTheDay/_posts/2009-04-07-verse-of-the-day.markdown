_Psalm 16:11  
Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of
joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore._

This verse has reference to Jesus Christ, who became the very
"pathway of life" for all humanity. He joyfully died on the cross for
your sins, and rose on the third day conquering the fear of death for
the believer. If you will look forward beyond this life, you will see
an eternal Heaven, with abundant pleasures. With this picture in your
mind, live your day in victory!
