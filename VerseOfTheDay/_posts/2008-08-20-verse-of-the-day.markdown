_Hebrews 11:1  
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen._

Faith is vitally important in the life of every believer if you are
to please God. God wants you to trust Him and believe in Him for the
unknown. It&rsquo;s easy to go through a door if you know
what&rsquo;s on the other side. Faith enables you to open unknown
doors, knowing that God is with you no matter what.
