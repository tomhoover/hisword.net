_Isaiah 41:13  
For I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee,
fear not; I will help thee._

Are you worried or concerned over an uncertain situation in your
life? The Lord thy God, wants you to know that you can give it to
Him, and you don't need to be fearful. He has helped every generation
from Adam to this present day, and He will help you, if you are His
child.
