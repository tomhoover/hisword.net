_Galatians 3:11  
But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is
evident: for, The just shall live by faith._

Living by FAITH...what would that mean in the twentieth century?
Trusting God for the bills after paying your tithe. Sharing God's
plan of salvation with an evil person. Walking in the midst of a
violent society. Speaking loving words to those who hate. These are
all expressions of FAITH in your world. We are reminded once again,
that God measures us according to our FAITH. Be a person of FAITH in
your world today!
