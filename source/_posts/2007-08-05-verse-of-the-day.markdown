_Psalm 79:13  
So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for
ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations._

We have a history which will survive all other records, and it is
bright in every line with the glory of the Lord. From the direst
calamities, God's glory springs, and the dark days of His people
become the prelude to unusual displays of the Lord's love and power.
We are bought with a price; we are not our own; but we know that all
things work together for God&rsquo;s good purposes, that often have
far reaching effects, well beyond the scope of our own.
