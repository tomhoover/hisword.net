_Matthew 6:32b  
For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these
things._

Are you running a little short on money this year? Maybe God is
trying to tell you that you really don't NEED all those "wants"! Be
content with what you have, and you won't be so stressed out when the
bills come in January.
