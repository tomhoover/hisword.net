_Psalm 122:6  
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love
thee._

The city of Jerusalem has always been a city with conflicts. This
often can be a picture of our lives. There will always be conflicts,
but prayer is the key to prospering in the midst of conflict. Take
time to pray for your own personal conflicts, and then pray for the
return of Jesus Christ to bring eternal peace to Jerusalem.
