_Ephesians 6:18  
Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and
watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all
saints._

When was the last time you prayed for a missionary or pastor
laboring for the Lord? Godly servants know full well the power of
prayer, and they covet the prayers of God's people. Our verse
encourages us to pray, not only for ourselves, but others. Take a
moment to pray for a pastor or missionary whom God lays on your
heart. It will make a difference in their day, and yours.
