title: May 5th - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.
---

_Philippians 4:8  
Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are
honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,
whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report;
if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these
things._

"Whatcha thinkin'?" Have you ever had someone ask you that
question? If you realized how powerful your thoughts were, you would
purpose to never think a negative thought again. Did you notice that
our verse admonishes you to think "good thoughts?" This means that
when those "bad thoughts" come into your mind, or someone tells you
something bad about someone else, you must cast it down. You become
what you think. Don't become someone who has "stinkin' thinkin'!"
