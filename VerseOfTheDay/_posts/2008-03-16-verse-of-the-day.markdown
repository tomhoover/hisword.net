_Matthew 6:31-32  
31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What
shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?  
32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your
heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things._

It is important to God that His people regularly come together to
celebrate His goodness and provision. Something happens when you are
with God&rsquo;s people that cannot happen when you are alone. Praise
Him in His place!
