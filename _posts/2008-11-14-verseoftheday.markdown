title: November 14th - Partnership with God in Prayer
---

_Matthew 9:38  
Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send for
labourers into His harvest._

Pray for spiritual leaders. We need strong, dedicated, spiritual
leaders who will stand for the truth in these difficult days. There
is a need for new leaders to come alongside present leaders and learn
what it means to be faithful until death. According to our Lord you
should be praying every day for your present leader and for new
leaders! The power of leadership hinges upon the prayers of God's
people!
