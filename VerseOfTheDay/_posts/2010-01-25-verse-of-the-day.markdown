_Romans 15:2  
Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to
edification._

The challenge in our verse is to help people and leave them better
than you found them. When geese fly in a V-shape, each bird creates
an updraft for the bird behind it. They can fly 70% longer with the
help of another bird, rather than going it alone. Geese also honk at
one another, not as critics, but to encourage. There are so many in
our world, like the geese, who need encouragement and someone who
will give them the hope to keep going. Is there someone flying in
formation with you today, with whom you could give some helpful
"honks?"
