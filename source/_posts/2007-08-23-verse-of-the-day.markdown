_Proverbs 12:25  
Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word
maketh it glad._

Are you a heart stooper or a heart lifter? Every day, every person
has a spiritual heart that is stooped very low, lifted very high, or
anywhere in between. Enter you! With your words and/or your actions,
you can stoop or lift your brother&rsquo;s heart. For example the
Bible says. "Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one
another, even as also ye do" (1 Thess. 5:11). Be a heart lifter, not
a heart stooper or stopper.
