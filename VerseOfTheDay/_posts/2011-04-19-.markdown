_Ephesians 3:19  
And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye
might be filled with all the fulness of God._

The soldiers put nails through His hands and feet, securing Him to
the wooden cross, but the nails didn't hold His body in place. It was
the mighty POWER of LOVE that held humanity's future securely in
place. Such LOVE is beyond our human imagination! It is this same
POWER of LOVE, like that on Calvary's hill, that will hold you in the
midst of your struggles. This is being filled with the FULL NESS of
God! Submit to your cross, and FAITH will unleash the POWER of GOD!
