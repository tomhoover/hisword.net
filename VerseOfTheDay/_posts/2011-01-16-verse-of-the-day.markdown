_Psalm 119:133  
Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion
over me._

Do you ever find yourself in a place where you don't know what to
do about something? God uses His WORD to guide us in our daily lives.
He will give you instruction and direction from His WORD, if you will
just turn to Him. Before you go any further, open His WORD and let
Him talk to you.
