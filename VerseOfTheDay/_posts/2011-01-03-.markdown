_II Peter 1:21  
For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy
men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost._

The Bible is the written WORD of God, as God spoke it into the ears
of holy men. People in this world ridicule its authenticity, saying it
couldn't be accurate since it was written down by so many men, so long
ago. They say it's just campfire stories and traditions of men, not
truth from God. They just don't know!! If God has preserved the
Universe, enabling life (you) to exist in it, He could preserve His
written WORDS! No other WORDS have endured thousands of years, and
can connect you with your purpose on this earth! Don't take God's
WORDS casually, they are powerful!
