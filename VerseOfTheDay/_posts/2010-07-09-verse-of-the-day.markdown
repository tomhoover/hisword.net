_Revelation 2:10b  
...be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of
life._

There's no quitting in God&rsquo;s army! His followers are soldiers
who faithfully serve their Lord. We do not need to be pampered, pumped
up, picked up or pepped up. We have the fire of His Words in our soul.
We are committed to our Leader. Battles and trials cannot beat us.
Money and worldly power cannot buy us! We will not give up, and we
will not turn around! We will be faithful soldiers marching onward
until we leave this earth! Will you be faithful until death? Don't
get bushwhacked by the enemy, as the rewards of heaven will be
greater than you can imagine!
