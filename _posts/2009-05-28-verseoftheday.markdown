title: May 28th - Partnership with God in Attitude and Mind-Set
---

_Matthew 7:1  
Judge not, that ye be not judged._

If you find yourself always seeing what is wrong with other people
before you see what is good about them, you are really in need of an
attitude change! Truth is, believe it or not, you were not created
for such negative work. Our verse today reminds us that God will
bless you if you will leave the judging up to Him. That should
lighten and brighten your day!
