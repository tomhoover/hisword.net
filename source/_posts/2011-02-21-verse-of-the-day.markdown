_I Corinthians 10:12  
Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
fall._

What does pride have to do with spiritual warfare? When you are
"full of yourself," you don't need God, and you will try to fight
your battles in your own strength. If you would just bend the knee,
you could save a lot of pain and suffering. Don't go it alone! You
need GOD now!
