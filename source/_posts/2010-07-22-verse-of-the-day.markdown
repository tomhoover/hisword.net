_I Corinthians 15:58  
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your
labour is not in vain in the Lord._

From time to time we are in situations that we feel are hopeless
and going nowhere. No matter how hard we work, or how often we try,
it seems we are not making any progress. We want to give up on what
looks like a lost cause. When you feel that way, just think about the
empty tomb and stand firm! God can resurrect your hope, causing you to
be immovable in your commitment to keep praying for that hard heart,
to keep sharing the gospel with that lost friend, and to keep loving
that difficult person. EXTREME LOVE!
