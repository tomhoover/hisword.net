title: March 13th - Partnership with God to Touch Lives
---

_Romans 10:1  
Brethren, my heart&rsquo;s desire and prayer to God for Israel is,
that they might be saved._

Someone needs you to pray for them today. It is through prayer that
we are connected to the Source of all power, Who alone can touch and
change lives. As God gives you names and faces, take the time to pray
for these people throughout your day.
