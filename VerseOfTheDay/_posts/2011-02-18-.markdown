title: February 18th - FaithForce...engaging your faith in Spiritual
---

_Matthew 26:41  
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed
is willing, but the flesh is weak._

People who don't believe, think prayer is a waste of time. The
truth is, this is a good definition of faith. Faith prays, unbelief
does not. If you have a growing FAITH, you will become a prayer
warrior! Watch (or be alert to the enemy's ways) and Pray! It's God's
secret weapon for dealing with temptation. Do you believe? FAITH in
God is powerful! It's called FAITH Force!
