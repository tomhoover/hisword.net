title: February 9th - Extreme Love...is gracious, not rude.
---

_I Peter 3:10  
For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his
tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile._

Someone said, "Words can make a deeper scar, than silence can
heal." Another saying that we have all grown up with is, "If you
can't say something nice, don't say anything at all." Anyway you put
it, it's better to keep your mouth shut and say fewer words, than to
say something you might be sorry for later. Before you go any further
into your day, stop and ask God to put a watch upon your lips, so that
you might glorify Him with your life!
