title: September 19th - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Psalm 103:2-3  
2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:  
3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
diseases._

Every one of us know someone in our lives who has a health problem.
Sometimes we can be guilty of looking at their physical condition,
instead of their spiritual condition. Knowing Jesus Christ has
forgiven your sins and healed your spiritual heart, is your greatest
health benefit. Take time to thank God for your benefits.
