_II Timothy 1:13  
Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in
faith and love which is in Christ Jesus._

Do you ever feel like you are "holding on by a thread?" In other
words, you haven't given up, but you feel like you are about at the
end of your FAITH? We are encouraged in our verse to "HOLD ON!" You
can do this by reviewing the FAITH and LOVE of our Lord Jesus Christ.
He laid aside His personal desires for a greater cause, and you can do
the same! Be encouraged, Christian! Your "thread" becomes a mighty
chain, when you include Jesus Christ!
