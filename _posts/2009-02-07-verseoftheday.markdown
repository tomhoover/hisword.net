title: February 7th - Partnership with God in Loving Relationships
---

_I Peter 3:8-9  
8 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another,
love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous;  
9 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing; but
contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye
should inherit a blessing._

Take the Christian challenge today: Show love to those who are
hateful. Be kind to someone who is rude. Hold your tongue in the face
of criticism. Bless those who curse you. This is possible, if you will
purpose to have the mind of Christ, and ask for His help.
