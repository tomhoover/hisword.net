_I John 5:14  
And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any
thing according to his will, he heareth us._

The purpose of praying to our heavenly Father is not to get our
every will and desire met by Him. Instead, prayer is a means by which
we can lay our every care upon Him, asking Him to answer our requests
according to His will. It's great to know and have confidence in the
fact that God faithfully hears us and answers according to what is
best for us. When you talk to your heavenly Father today, thank Him
for faithfully hearing and providing for you.
