_Psalm 31:23  
O love the LORD, all ye His saints: for the LORD perserveth the
faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer._

What has the LORD done for you lately? Do you have food to eat? Do
you have a place to sleep? You can forget to thank God for faithfully
supplying all your daily needs and blessings. Often God is waiting on
your praise so He can release His blessings upon you.
