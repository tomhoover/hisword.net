_Ephesians 6:16  
Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to
quench all the fiery darts of the wicked._

The "fiery darts" in your life today will come in the form of
negative thoughts, anxious feelings, outright lies, and fear of the
known and unknown. When your shield is in place, these darts can't
get to you. Your FAITH in God becomes a shield that will protect you,
if you are to fight against the enemy! Don't start the day without
your shield! You are going to need it!
