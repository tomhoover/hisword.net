title: December 17th - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_I Peter 1:8  
Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not,
yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory._

If a non-believer wanted proof that God was real, would your life
confirm or disprove the existence of God? One of the greatest
evidences of God is a changed life. Another term for that is "extreme
love." This love is so radical that it changes your heart and works
itself out in your life in expressions of JOY and happiness. In the
midst of this cruel dark world, this "JOY" stands out like a bright
light of hope! Purpose to brighten your world with JOY today!
