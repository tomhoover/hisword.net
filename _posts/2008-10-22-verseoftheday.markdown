_John 4:34  
Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of Him that sent
me, and to finish His work._

Hello? Hope you aren't planning on laying around too much today.
The mighty Creator, who worked the first six days of creation, before
He even took a rest, created you to work also! You've got a part in
finishing His work on this earth! Get busy and tell someone about
Jesus!
