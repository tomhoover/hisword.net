_Psalm 34:15  
The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open
unto their cry._

Our God desires to develop a personal relationship with His
children. He knows your innermost thoughts. He feels your fears and
desires to take them upon Himself. He hears the silent and most
mysterious sounds of your heart, even when your lips can&rsquo;t form
the words to communicate them. He loves you and you are always on His
mind.
