title: June 19th - Extreme Love...rejoices in truth.
---

_Psalm 51:6  
Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden
part thou shalt make me to know wisdom._

God desires TRUTH to be on the inside of you. What does this TRUTH
look like? Sincerity, love, integrity, purity, reverence, holiness,
and faith, are just a few of things that God desires to see when He
looks at your heart. He will help you to grow in wisdom in these
things if you will but ask Him. May you prepare your inward being to
the same proportion as you prepare your outward appearance today.
