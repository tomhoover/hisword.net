_Psalm 49:11  
Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever,
and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands
after their own names._

How foolish we can be to think that the material possessions we
have now will always be ours! As the economy has been challenged in
these last days, we are made to realize that all of this earth's
material possessions can be taken away at any moment. That is why
FAITH is so valuable in your life. It can be passed from one
generation to the next, and when this is done, its value only
increases! Don't put your FAITH in this world...we're only passing
through!
