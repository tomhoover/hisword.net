_Galatians 5:1  
Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us
free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage._

Happy Fourth of July! As you are celebrating the liberty and
freedom that we enjoy as a nation, don't forget to acknowledge the
spiritual liberty and freedom we are also given through the gospel of
Jesus Christ. In fact, if you have an opportunity, it would be great
to tell someone else about freedom from the condemnation of sin!
Enjoy your day, but don't forget your Savior.
