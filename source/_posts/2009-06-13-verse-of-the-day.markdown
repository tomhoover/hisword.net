_Jeremiah 1:8  
Be not afraid of their faces; for I am with thee to deliver thee,
said the Lord._

Someone said, "Sorrow looks back, worry looks around, but FAITH
looks up." When your focus is on God and what He can do, you have
nothing to fear. Put God first, and let Him handle the difficult
situations, problems, and people in your life. You can trust God to
stay by your side and to deliver you!
