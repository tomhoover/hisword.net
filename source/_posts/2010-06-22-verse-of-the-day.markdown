_John 16:13  
Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he
shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to
come._

You are not alone when it comes to searching out TRUTH today. The
believer has the help of the Holy Spirit, Who promises to guide you
and teach you. Not all of the TRUTH that the Holy Spirit reveals to
you will make you feel good. Often times, His TRUTH will show you
where you need to make some changes in your life. Aren't you glad God
knows just how much TRUTH you can handle on any given day?
/Thank you, Holy Spirit, for leading us in TRUTH, understanding each
one of us individually, and giving us just what we need!/
