_Mark 8:35  
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall
lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it._

Are you a winner or a loser? If you give your life to God to be
used for His honor and glory, you win every time. You aren't
responsible for the results. You are just asked to sow the good seed!
Purpose to be a winner today! Your Partner wants to work with you. Be
part of a winning team!
