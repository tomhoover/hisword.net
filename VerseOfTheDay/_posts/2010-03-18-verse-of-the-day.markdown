_Ephesians 3:20  
Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that
we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us._

Our verse is reminding us that we should never measure our problems
by our own capacity to deal with them. Most often our spiritual
defeats come from self reliance. When you factor God into your life
you will see that He is above anything you have accomplished or could
even imagine to do. The words used to describe the power of God are
"exceeding abundantly" beyond anything you could even think! That's
our awesome God! Be encouraged if you are His child. There is nothing
that can separate you from His powerful LOVE!
