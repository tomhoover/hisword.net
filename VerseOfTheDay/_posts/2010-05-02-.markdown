title: May 2nd - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.
---

_Psalm 119:165  
Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend
them._

In the Bible we are told to "hold our peace," because great peace
is the place where God's power prevails. The key to getting that
peace in your heart is thinking upon God and His Word, rather than
the offense. When that unjust thought comes into your mind, say this
verse out loud. God will empower and bless those who choose peace
over self gratification.
