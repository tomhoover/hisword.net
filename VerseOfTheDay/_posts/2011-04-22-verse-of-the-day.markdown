_Ephesians 3:20  
Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that
we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us._

GOOD MORNING BULLETIN: Here's some good news for the Christian in
the midst of this sin-cursed world. GOD IS ABLE! Not only is He able,
He is able to do more than you can even ask or think! Jesus proved
this on the cross and through His resurrection! No one has ever
duplicated His resurrected life! It was beyond, more than a human
probability! The rest of the good news is this: That same power is
within you, if you believe, and He will help you more than you can
possibly ask or think!
