_Psalm 31:24  
Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that
hope in the LORD._

Courage is an attitude of the heart. It is having an outlook of
confidence, boldness, and expectation of God's deliverance in the
toughest of situations. When you exhibit courage and refuse to quit
or lose heart about a situation, you have responded in faith. It is
then that God will give you His strength to carry on! Claim His
promise today, you will get the victory!
