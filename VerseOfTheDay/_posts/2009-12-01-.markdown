title: December 1st - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_I Corinthians 13:4c  
...charity envieth not..._

How do you find yourself at the beginning of this month? You can
easily find yourself overwhelmed at such a busy time of the year. One
of the keys to enjoying this wonderful season, is finding contentment
with what you already possess. When you fully comprehend God's
personal, intimate love for you, envy of worldly possessions holds no
comparison. Be joyous, Christian, you are very blessed! Emmanuel has
come to dwell with you!
