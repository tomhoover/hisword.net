title: April 22nd- God&rsquo;s Place of Care
---

_Psalm 17:8  
Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy
wings._

In the Hebrew, &ldquo;apple&rdquo; means, &ldquo;little man&rdquo;.
If you look at the reflection of yourself in someone else&rsquo;s eye,
you are a little object. Proud people don&rsquo;t need God. On the
other hand, humble people can always find a place under God&rsquo;s
wing. Be a humble servant to others today!
