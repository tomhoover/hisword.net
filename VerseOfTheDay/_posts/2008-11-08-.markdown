title: November 8th - Partnership with God in Prayer
---

_Mark 11:25-26  
25 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any:
that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your
trespasses.  
26 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in
heaven forgive your trespasses._

Do you ever feel like your prayers aren't getting above your head?
They may not be reaching God's ears if you are harboring a grudge
against someone. Before you go any further today, stop and ask God to
bring to mind any situation or person with whom you might have an
issue. Prayerfully and humbly ask God&rsquo;s forgiveness and you
will feel the closeness of His presence once again.
