_Psalm 91:4  
He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt
thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler._

Most of the time, FAITH isn't rewarded with instant justification.
There are times when we must WAIT for God to act on our behalf. Our
verse connects care with truth. Truth will be rewarded, but until
that moment, God promises to comfort you. God compares His love to a
bird who draws its young under its wings, keeping them safe from the
enemy. God is intimately involved in your life! Believe it and be
FAITH FULL to Him!
