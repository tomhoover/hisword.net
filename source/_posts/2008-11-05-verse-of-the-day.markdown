_Psalm 17:6  
I have called upon Thee, for Thou wilt hear me, O God: incline Thine
ear unto me, and hear my speech._

When you have a constant awareness of God's presence with you,
prayer is as natural as breathing. If you will purpose to focus on
God, you will find yourself praying more and wanting to share
everything with your Partner. Be mindful to pause and just listen.
God still speaks to His children.
