_Romans 4:5  
But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth
the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness._

Gotcha! Now how did God know you would need this verse every day of
your life? He understands you better than you understand yourself!
God, in His foreknowledge, knew this would be Adam and Eve's problem,
and yours. You were not made to be self sufficient, but the Devil has
been trying to persuade you differently since the creation of the
world. You need God's help and purpose for your life! GOD's got all
you need! Have you got Him? FAITH!
