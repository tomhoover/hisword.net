_Psalm 10:17  
LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare
their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear._

Time out! Chances are you have entered this day, as most days, on a
time schedule. God has been listening for you to connect with Him. If
you will humble your heart and seek Him, you will discover the
dividends of His time clock.
