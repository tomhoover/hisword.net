_John 6:69  
And we believe and are sure that Thou art that Christ, the Son of
the living God._

You may have settled the question of "Is Jesus Christ the Son of
God?". But, there are many in this world who have not. Many have put
their faith in evolution and atheism. You will be representing Christ
to a lost world today! Will your faith, attitudes, and actions show
them that you are a believer? May your FAITH challenge the
unbelieving world all around you today!
