title: July 31st - Partnership with God in Sacrifice
---

_Ephesians 5:2  
And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given
himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a
sweet-smelling savor._

Love is proven through sacrifice. Jesus Christ proved His love for
you by sacrificing His life for your sins. Your love for Jesus Christ
is proven daily as you sacrifice your will for God's will. What will
you do for Jesus today?
