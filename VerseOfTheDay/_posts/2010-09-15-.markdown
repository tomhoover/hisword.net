title: September 15th - Extreme Love...endures through trials.
---

_II Samuel 22:33-34  
God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect. He
maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high
places._

Back in Bible times, the red female deer was referred to as a hind,
and it was known for its swiftness in running over the most
treacherous landscapes. There are other deer mentioned in the Bible,
but hinds are only mentioned by two men, David and Habbakuk, 400
years apart, as having this unique quality. Next time you are in a
treacherous situation, reclaim this mental picture of God giving you
the power and strength to escape all those who pursue you.
