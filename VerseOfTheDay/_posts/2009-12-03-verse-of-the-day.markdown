_Proverbs 6:34  
For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in
the day of vengeance._

Someone said, "Love looks through a telescope, but envy looks
through a microscope." When you really love someone, you have the
patience to work through problems. Jealous people, most of the time,
are being controlled by their emotions, and it takes very little to
arouse their anger. Let love rule in your life today! Be joyful!
