_Matthew 18:12  
How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be
gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into
the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?_

Being finite minded, we cannot really conceive how God can have so
many children and still deal with you and I as if we were His only
child. He tells us, through Peter, to cast all of our cares in Him
because he cares for us. Gordon Jensen once wrote a song with the
words, "Tears are a language that God understands." Are you hurting
today? Are you starting to stray away? God is already working to
bring you back. God loves you.
