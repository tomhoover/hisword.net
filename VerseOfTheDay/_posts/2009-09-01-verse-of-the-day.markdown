_I Corinthians 12:18  
But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as
it hath pleased him._

It's God's plan for everyone to be in a church where they can serve
Him. Has God put you in a church? It's exciting to think that God, in
His wisdom, will lead you to a specific church where you can become
part of His body. The followup question is, "Have you found a church,
and have you found a place to serve in that church?"
