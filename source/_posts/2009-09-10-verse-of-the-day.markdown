_Hebrews 10:25  
Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of
some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see
the day approaching._

What if you were told that you couldn't go to church any more? What
would you miss most? In our ever-present, changing world, we must
serve the Lord while we can. There may come a day when we can not
openly worship with others. With that in mind, make the most of this
day and every day. Invite someone to go to church with you next
Sunday.
