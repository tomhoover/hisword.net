_I Thessalonians 2:13  
For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye
received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as
the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which
effectually worketh also in you that believe._

It's Sunday...and it's time to get a Word of TRUTH from the Lord.
If you have a pastor who faithfully presents God's TRUTH from His
Word, you are blessed. He tries his best every week to find the heart
of God and give it to you. Have you thanked him lately for all the
time and preparation he puts into presenting God's TRUTH to you? It
might encourage him, and make you a better church member.
