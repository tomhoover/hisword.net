title: August 22nd - God&rsquo;s Place of Faithfulness
---

_Isaiah 55:8  
For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my
ways, saith the LORD._

Dear God,
Today, I purpose to elevate my thoughts and ways, so that they
reflect your faithful heart. You always lift me up and make me
better! Thank you for knowing what I need today. I trust you!
Your Child
