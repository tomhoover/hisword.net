_II Corinthians 10:4  
For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through
God to the pulling down of strong holds._

It's war! If you find yourself in a continual spiritual struggle in
a particular area, and it seems that you aren't getting the victory,
you could be using the wrong weapons. Our verse today reminds us,
that when strongholds of sin take over in our lives, we must use
spiritual weapons if we want victory. The spiritual weapons are
prayer and God's Word. You must be broken and empty of yourself, or
they are not effective. In fact, as long as you are trying to work
things using your resources, God's spiritual weapons are impeded.
Declare your FAITH and dependence upon God, you need Him! It's war!
