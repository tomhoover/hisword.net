_Psalm 23  
1The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
2He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside
the still waters.
3He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
for his name's sake.
4Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they
comfort me.
5Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
6Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever._

The life of a sheep in the lands of ancient Israel and surrounding
areas was difficult, at best, with its rocky terrains, steep gorges
and countless carnivorous predators who would kill for a lamb dinner
(ha). However, with the presence and protection of their shepherd,
they had no worries. He loved every last one of them, and as long as
a sheep followed his shepherd, he would have all he needed and more!
The picture is of Jesus, who said, "I am the good shepherd, the good
shepherd giveth his life for the sheep." Why? because He loves us. A
dear sister recently went home to be with the Lord. The Good Shepherd
was with her in the valley of death, and now, she will "dwell in the
house of the LORD forever" because of her faith in the "Great
Shepherd" of her faith.
