title: August 3rd - Partnership with God for a Changed Life
---

_II Corinthians 5:17  
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things
are passed away; behold, all things are become new._

Could you use something "new" in your life? When you ask Christ
into your heart, you are given a fresh new start with the dawning of
each new day. You are to forget the mistakes of yesterday and walk in
the mercy and grace of today!
