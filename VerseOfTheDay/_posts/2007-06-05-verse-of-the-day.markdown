_Psalm 25:9  
The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his
way._

Jesus said that the meek will inherit the earth. Meekness is a
close relative with humility and gentleness, yet meekness is the
enemy of weakness. Jesus said He was "meek and lowly," yet He was the
complete opposite of weakness. The meek believer is a wise and
faithful believer who is allowing Jesus Christ to manifest His
amazing strength in his life. Our nation needs more of these kinds of
leaders.
