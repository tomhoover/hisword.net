title: June 8th - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith
---

_James 1:2-3  
1 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers
temptations;  
2 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience._

You probably didn't wake up today wishing God would give you some
problems to handle, but sometimes that's the way He works. Throughout
God's Word we are reminded that the "trying of your faith" is a
precious thing. God is wanting to spend some close special time with
you, that more than likely would never happen, if things were good.
Patiently and persistently call upon the Lord. That's how your heart
can find "joy" in the midst of hard times.
