_I Corinthians 13:7a  
Beareth all things..._

When you really love someone, and they are carrying a heavy load,
it is only natural that you would want to help them if you could. Our
"Extreme Love" statement takes that a step further. It asks you not to
qualify your care for others, choosing only those you know. Extreme
Love bears the burdens of ALL those who God puts in your path. May
you have eyes to see and hands to uphold those who NEED God's LOVE
shown to them today.
