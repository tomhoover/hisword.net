title: July 22nd - Partnership with God in Sacrifice
---

_Proverbs 15:1  
A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up
anger._

This is going to be one of those days when, if you aren't focused
on saying the right thing, you might be sorry. Before you go any
further, stop and ask God to help your words to be kind and soft to
those you come in contact with today. Your Partner can put those
potential fires out, with the breath of His Spirit.
