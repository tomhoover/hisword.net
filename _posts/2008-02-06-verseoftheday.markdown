title: February 6th - God's Place of Presence
---

_Hebrews 10:22  
Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies
washed with pure water._

There are times when sin in our lives can make God's presence seem
so far away. When we confess and forsake our sin, we will feel the
warmth of His presence once again. Draw close to Him with a clean
heart.
