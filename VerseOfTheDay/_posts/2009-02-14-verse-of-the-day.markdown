_John 13:34  
A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I
have loved you, that ye also love one another._

It's Valentine's Day, a day when love is most often expressed
between people. God expressed His love to you through His blood
sacrifice on Calvary. Will you show your appreciation for Him today
by sharing His gospel with someone? If you do, you will have truly
loved another, as He did.
