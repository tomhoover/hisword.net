_II Corinthians 3:17-18  
17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
there is liberty.  
18 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of
the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even
as by the Spirit of the Lord._

The exciting message to us here is the freedom of access to God,
without fear, in opposition to the fear associated with God's
presence as described in Exodus 34:30. When Jesus died on that cross,
the veil of the Temple, which kept the people separated from direct
access to God, was torn in two. That veil was replaced by Jesus
Christ Himself whom the Bible calls the "veil." We need no other veil
and we have free access to God and His throne of grace.
