title: January 12th - Partnership with God in Daily Disciplines
---

_James 1:4  
But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and
entire, wanting nothing._

We are reminded from our verse that as we become more mature and
grow in our knowledge of God and His ways, our expectations change.
God knows what and when to give us things in life. A disciplined mind
trusts God's hand, needing His Presence more than anything else. Peter
Marshall said, /" Teach us, O Lord, the disciplines of patience, for
to wait is often harder than to work."/
