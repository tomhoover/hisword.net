_Isaiah 43:2  
When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest
through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame
kindle upon thee._

As you are traveling in a car today, think about all the times that
God has protected you and taken care of you. You will probably want to
shout, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo; unless you still have teenagers at
home. If that is the case, you should pray continually for
God&rsquo;s protection. God cares, do you?
