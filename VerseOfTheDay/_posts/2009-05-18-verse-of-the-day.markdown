_III John 1:5  
Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
brethren, and to strangers._

It's Monday!! You probably could have used a day to yourself, but
your verse admonishes you to be faithful to encourage brethren in the
Lord, and those who are strangers. Make up your mind to at least
"smile" at those who cross your path today. A good attitude will make
you feel better than you really do.
