_Ephesians 6:15  
And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace._

Where are your feet going to take you today? That will depend upon
your relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. If you have prepared
your heart before you embark on your day, you will be more apt to
walk in peace with God, and others. Take a moment to connect with
your heavenly Father, as He longs to walk with you today!
