_II Corinthians 2:14  
Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of His knowledge by us in
every place._

Every place you go today, be reminded that you are a child of the
King and you are never a victim of your circumstances. God rules over
all and He has the power to make you victorious over whatever comes
your way today. Faith makes it possible for you to thank God in
advance, knowing He&rsquo;s going to help you.
