_II Corinthians 5:17  
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things
are passed away; behold, all things are become new._

There is one little word in this verse that messes us up all the
time. It's the "if!" Now, why did God have to give us a choice? One
reason would be that it pleases Him to see obedience. It's sort of
like a test. He knows we really mean business with Him when we change
our lives to do what He asks of us. One way of obeying God would be to
embrace His command to worship and serve Him through His church. He
knows that Christians need their FAITH strengthened, and He longs to
see your obedience!
