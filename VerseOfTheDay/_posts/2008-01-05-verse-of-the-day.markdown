title: January 5th - God's Place of Power
---

_Ephesians 3:20  
Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that
we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us._

Are you aspiring to do something beyond your own capabilities this
new year? We limit ourselves when we don&rsquo;t ask God to do His
"great work" in our lives.
