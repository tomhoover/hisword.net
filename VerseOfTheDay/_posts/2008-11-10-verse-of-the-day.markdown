_Psalm 40:1  
I waited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and heard
my cry._

Do you have a specific prayer request that you feel God has not
answered? Don't be discouraged, as waiting is often part of God's
answer. The omniscient God sees the big picture for your life, and
timing is everything in His plan. If you are in a waiting period,
it's comforting to know God is close beside you, just waiting for the
perfect time to give you His very best.
