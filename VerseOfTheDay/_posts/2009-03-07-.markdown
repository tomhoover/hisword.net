title: March 7th - Partnership with God to Touch Lives
---

_Acts 1:8  
But ye shall received power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all
Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth._

Sometimes we can come to think that we are not significant in this
big world in which we live. That is far from the truth! If you would
but pray specifically for one particular missionary today, you would
make a difference in their life. Reach out and touch your world
through prayer.
