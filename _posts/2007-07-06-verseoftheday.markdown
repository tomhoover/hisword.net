_Psalm 139:12  
Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as
the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee._

Sinful man, without the righteousness of Christ that saves, which
only comes by repentance of sin and faith in Christ's sacrifice, is
convinced in his corrupted nature that he can somehow hide from God
and escape His judgment. How foolish! Praise God for His light that
reveals man's sin and man's hopelessness, giving him opportunity to
turn from the darkness of that sin to the light of salvation from
that sin by the magnificent grace of God.
