title: August 29th - God&rsquo;s Place of Faithfulness
---

_Revelation 2:10  
Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil
shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall
have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will
give thee a crown of life._

Anything in this life that's worthwhile will cost you something!
The athletes in the summer Olympic games have made sacrifices to
compete for a medal. As Christians we should faithfully make
sacrifices for the Lord Jesus Christ. What sacrifice will you make
today? The faithful will receive a crown!
