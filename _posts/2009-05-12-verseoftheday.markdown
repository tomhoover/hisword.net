title: May 12th - Partnership with God in Attitude and Mind-Set
---

_Isaiah 30:15  
For thus saith the Lord God, The Holy One of Israel; In returning
and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be
your strength: and ye would not._

There are times when it might seem that God isn't listening to your
prayer requests. It could be He's waiting to see your FAITH and
attitude of confidence in Him alone. Give your burdens to your
Partner today, and walk in quietness and confidence because of His
strength and promised care for you.
