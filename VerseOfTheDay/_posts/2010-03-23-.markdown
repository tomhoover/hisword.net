_II Corinthians 5:7  
For we walk by faith, not by sight._

To "walk by faith," means to make God a part of all your daily
activities. If you are able to examine a bridge up close, it will
help you make a decision whether to cross it or not. On the other
hand, if you can't see the bridge, it will require total faith. Our
verse reminds us not to take for granted your daily walk with God.
Don't trust in what you can see and your own strength when you make
decisions, put your total faith in God, not your sight.
