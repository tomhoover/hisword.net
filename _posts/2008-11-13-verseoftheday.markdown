title: November 13th - Partnership with God in Prayer
---

_Matthew 26:41  
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed
is willing, but the flesh is weak._

Be careful today! If you think you are able to handle the trials
and temptations of this day without God, you could be in for some
trouble. The Christian who calls upon God to protect his mind and
actions from the temptations of this world, before he starts his day,
is making a wise investment.
/"Prayer will make a man cease from sin, or sin will entice a man to
cease from prayer."/ &ndash;John Bunyon
