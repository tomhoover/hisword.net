_Mark 11:25  
And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any:
that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your
trespasses._

In our verse unforgiveness is pictured as someone "standing" to
pray. This pictures the stubborn position of someone who refuses to
forgive another. The humble of heart find that when they are bowed on
their knees, they are more apt to look at their own heart. You don't
have to get on your knees to pray, but you are commanded to forgive
others. Start your day off in submission to God and in a right
relationship with mankind, and you will feel His presence close by.
