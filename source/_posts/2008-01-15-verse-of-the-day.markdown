_Psalm 19:14  
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer._

Do you need help with your mouth? Do you say things you are sorry
about later? It begins with your thoughts. Ask the Lord to help you
think right first, and then say things that would bring Him honor and
glory.
