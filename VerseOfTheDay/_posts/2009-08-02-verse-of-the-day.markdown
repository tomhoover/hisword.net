_II Corinthians 3:18  
But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the
Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by
the Spirit of the Lord._

What did you see when you looked in your mirror today? (The mirror
of God's Word.) More than likely, God reminded you to be more loving,
more patient, or more giving. You will never have enough love,
patience, or generosity! Purpose to be MORE for God today, and listen
as His Spirit talks to you.
