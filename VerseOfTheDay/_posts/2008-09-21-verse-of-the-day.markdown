title: September 21st - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Matthew 9:6  
But that ye may know that the son of God hath power to forgive sins,
(then saith he to the sick of the palsy, ) Arise, take up thy bed, and
go unto thy house._

If you have an unforgiving spirit toward anyone, it's as if you
were crippled and bound by your anger. When you forgive the unjust,
God's power is displayed to an unbelieving world. When you forgive
the unjust, it also allows you to be free from the crippling attitude
of bitterness. It's time to take up your bed and walk!
