_Romans 12:13  
Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality._

This verse is part of a list of things that are found in a
Christian's life who has genuine love for God and others. When you
love fellow believers, you will care for their needs. The root word
in hospitality is "hospital." Christians can get discouraged and down
from time to time and find themselves in need of encouragement. Do you
know a Christian that is going through a hard time? Make your home a
hospital for those that need spiritual care giving.
