_I Corinthians 10:13  
There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man; but
God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye
are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape,
that ye may be able to bear it._

Other people have faced the same temptations and trials that you
are presently going through. Those that called upon God for help have
been able to bear it, and so can you. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it will
be easy, as all change comes with a measure of pain. Your Partner
promises to be beside you all the way!
