_Isaiah 40:31  
But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they
shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be
weary; and they shall walk, and not faint._

Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. This verse says that it is when we are
waiting that our strength is renewed. Have you been feeling sluggish
lately? You must have left the waiting room!
