_Luke 2:29-32  
Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy
word: For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, Which thou hast prepared
before the face of all people; A light to lighten the Gentiles, and
the glory of thy people Israel._

The LIGHT that came to this earth 2,000 years ago is still going
after all that time! It is a LIGHT that cannot be put out. It is a
LIGHT that knows no discrimination. It is a LIGHT that brings peace
to a soul! Is this LIGHT shining brightly in your life? It's called
FAITH!
