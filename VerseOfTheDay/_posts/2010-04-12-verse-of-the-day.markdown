_Matthew 5:23-24  
Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to
do evil._

Why is it that when you are angry, you almost always do something
foolish? Lee Iacocca, a labor leader, gave his workers some good
advice, "In times of great stress or adversity, it's always best to
keep busy, to plow your anger and your energy into something
positive." In other words, get busy doing something good and just
forget it. Refocus your negative energy into positive actions!
EXTREME LOVE makes a difference!
