_Galatians 6:9  
And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall
reap, if we faint not._

This is NOT the day to be weary for doing good! This is the day
which the Lord hath made, and you must keep going! You are given a
promise that if you will stay faithful and keep loving and giving,
you will be rewarded. That's quite a deal! Make up your mind to face
opposition with love and patience, and ask God to give you the
strength to endure!
