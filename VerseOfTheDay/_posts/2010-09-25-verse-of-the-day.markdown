_II Corinthians 1:6  
And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and
salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings
which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your
consolation and salvation._

The verses before this verse, tell us that Paul was in the midst of
some hard times. As he was suffering, he was reminded of the
sufferings of Jesus Christ. One of the keys to our verse is the
phrase, "which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings."
Paul encourages us that this same mind-set becomes your salvation in
dealing with your own sufferings. That will help you move to the head
of the suffering class!! You can endure with the suffering Savior's
help!
