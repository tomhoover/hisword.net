title: December 6th - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_Ezekiel 33:31  
And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before
thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do
them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth
after their covetousness._

We say that Christmas is all about the birth of Jesus Christ, but
our actions are all about doing other things. There can be so much
activity in our lives, that we can become like the innkeeper, and
have "no room" or "no time" for Jesus. Purpose in your heart to make
this year different. Review the Christmas story every morning in your
mind, and ask God to remind you throughout your day, of the real gift
of life, Jesus!
