_Jeremiah 13:23  
Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then
may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil._

Wow! What a verse! Of course you can't change the color of your
skin, anymore than you can wash the spots off a leopard! There are
things in our lives that only God can change, and that we are totally
powerless to change someone else's life. This is the work of FAITH in
our lives! It opens up a world of things that might seem impossible,
were it not for God. Christian, are you excited? Your God can do the
impossible! Be FULL of FAITH today!
