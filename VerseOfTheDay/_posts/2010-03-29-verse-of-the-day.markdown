title: March 29th - Extreme Love...is giving.
---

_I John 3:17  
But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need,
and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the
love of God in him?_

Need a smile? Consider this quote from The Matchmaker: "Money is
like manure; it's not worth a thing unless it's spread around
encouraging young things to grow." When you give to others, you are
helping the love of God to grow in your life and the lives of others.
Are you smiling? Spread God's love around, it grows everywhere!
