_Psalm 25:5  
Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my
salvation; on thee do I wait all the day._

Lead me according to thy truth, and prove thyself faithful; lead me
into truth that I may know its preciousness, lead me by the way of
truth that I may manifest its spirit. David knew much, but he felt
his ignorance and desired further instruction; four times over in two
verses he applies for a scholarship to the University of Knowledge and
Grace.
