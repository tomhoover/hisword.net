_II Peter 1:4  
Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises:
that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having
escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust._

When you call upon God, He has promised to help you deal with the
temptations of this world. You need the Holy Spirit to help you
escape evil. Only fools plan to sin and ask forgiveness later.
