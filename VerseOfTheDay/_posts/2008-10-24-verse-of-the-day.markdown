_I Thessalonians 1:3  
Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love,
and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God
and our Father._

Could someone say of you today, that they saw your strong faith in
God put into action? Will someone see you show love to a discouraged
soul? When you show patience in the face of injustice, will anyone
notice? You can be sure that your partner, The Lord Jesus Christ,
takes notice. Take the challenge to be your best for Him today!
