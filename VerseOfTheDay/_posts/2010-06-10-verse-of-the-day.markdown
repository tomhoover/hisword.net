_Galatians 4:16  
Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?_

Have you ever had someone tell you something about yourself, and
before they are even finished, you are thinking in your mind how you
are going to DEFEND yourself? We must all be reminded that there is
probably a measure of TRUTH in everything that someone says about us.
Therefore we should humble ourselves, and listen before we respond.
Rather than be defensive, why not defer to God, and let Him reveal
the TRUTH of the matter? GOD KNOWS THE WHOLE TRUTH!
