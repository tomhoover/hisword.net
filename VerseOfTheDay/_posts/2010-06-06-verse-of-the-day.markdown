_Psalm 15:1-2  
LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy
hill? He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
speaketh the truth in his heart._

The Psalmist asks, "Lord, who's going to Your church today?" Are
YOU going to hear a word from God? Why should you go to church? It
pleases Jesus Christ, who gave His life for His church, and it was
designed to help you. Every time you go to church, TRUTH, referenced
from the Word of God, encourages you to live right, and strengthens
your faith. TRUTH and Christ's church are marching on, and nothing
will stop them! Don't be left behind!?
