_John 16:33  
These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace.
In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have
overcome the world._

There's a lot of war and strife going on in the Middle East right
now, have you noticed? There are a lot of troubles in the lives of
Christians also. The Bible tells us that there is always going to be
problems and tribulations. The answer for the Middle East and the
Christian is one and the same. Peace is found only in Jesus Christ!
It's not in possessions or negotiations, because JESUS alone brings
peace! FAITH-LIFT! Get your focus off the problem! Focus on Jesus and
pray for His overcoming POWER in your life.
