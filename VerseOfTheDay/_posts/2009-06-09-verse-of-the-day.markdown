_Psalm 119:71  
It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn Thy
statutes._

Here you are again, no matter how old you are or how long you've
known Jesus, we all find ourselves falling at the Master's feet in
need of His help. When will we learn that everything God orchestrates
in our lives is for our good? At the close of every day, may you have
learned something from God's Word that will make your FAITH in God
stronger!
