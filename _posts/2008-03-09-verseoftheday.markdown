title: March 9th - God&rsquo;s Place of Promise
---

_Romans 4:21  
And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able
also to perform._

Are you sure? Are you sure that God is going to take care of you?
If you are, then live like it all day, and share a smile with others
that reflects your confidence in God.
