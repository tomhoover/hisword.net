title: October 13th - The Basics of Partnership
---

_I Corinthians 3:16  
Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of
God dwelleth in you?_

Upon giving your heart to Jesus, you entered into a partnership
with God. Your body is no longer just yours, now God dwells in you.
Be careful where you go, what you think, and how you speak. You are
representing God in this great partnership.
