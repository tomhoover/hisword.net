title: September 26th - Extreme Love...endures through trials.

_Psalm 62:8  
Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before
him: God is a refuge for us._

There are times when we tend to "hold in" our feelings and needs,
instead of sharing them. Sometimes we don't share with other people,
thinking they might misunderstand us, or not have time for us. The
Psalmist reminds us that God is not only trustworthy, but He
understands and knows our need to share burdens. God declares that He
is a refuge, a shelter in the midst of the storm! Get out of the
downpour, and come into His Presence, where there is love and
peace.
