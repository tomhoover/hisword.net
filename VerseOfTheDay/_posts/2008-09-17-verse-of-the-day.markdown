_Psalm 51:10  
Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within
me._

Are you tired of the same old things in your life? Would you like
some excitement? Ask God to give you a right spirit and clean heart
today. This might mean you would have to change some things in your
life. You can do this when you are secure in God's love. Accept the
challenge and make God "look good" today!
