title: June 29th - Extreme Love...rejoices in truth.
---

_Psalm 31:5  
Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD
God of truth._

TRUTH never penetrates an unwilling, closed mind. Some people, when
they hear the TRUTH, rebel at the thought of having to submit to
anyone telling them what to do. On the other hand, if they would only
commit themselves to the LORD, and put their faith and trust in Him,
He would guide them in TRUTH and redeem them from the wages of sin.
How does this verse relate to those who have already made a
commitment? You must give your life back to God every day while you
are walking upon this earth. There will always be a power struggle
between your selfish desires and God's TRUTH.
