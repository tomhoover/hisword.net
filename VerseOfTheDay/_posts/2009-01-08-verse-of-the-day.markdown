_Psalm 17:5  
Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not._

All of us have those days where we would just like to stay in bed
and have a day off to ourselves. Most of the time that is not
possible. If today is one of those days for you, envision God's arms
holding you up and guiding your path. God longs for fellowship with
you and He wants to help you and talk to you throughout your day.
This is the next best thing to having the day off!
