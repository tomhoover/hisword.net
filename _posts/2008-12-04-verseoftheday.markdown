title: December 4th - Partnership with God in Personal Finances
---

_Malachi 3:10  
Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat
in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I
will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing,
that there shall not be room enough to receive it._

When you put God at the top of your "to give" list, He partners
with you to make the rest of your money go farther. In fact, He also
blesses you with all those things that money can't buy! It's a wise
investment!
