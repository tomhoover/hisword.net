_Matthew 25:23  
His Lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou
hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over
many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord._

The best way to not overspend during the Christmas season is to
have a budget. If you will be faithful to the Lord and your budget,
the Lord will bless you with things you didn't even expect.
