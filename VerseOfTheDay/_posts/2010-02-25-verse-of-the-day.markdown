_II Peter 3:18  
But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen._

Here we are again! We are being reminded that we can become a more
gracious person to others, as we grow in our knowledge of the Lord
Jesus Christ. Looks like we will always be challenged to be more for
the glory of God. Sorry, the Christian life is not for slackers who
only want to get by. You're in the Lord's Army and have a job to do
every day. Read that Bible and grow in knowledge, so you can be a
good representative of Jesus, today!
