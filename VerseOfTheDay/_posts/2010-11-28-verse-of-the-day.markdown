_II Timothy 3:16  
All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness._

Do you like a bargain? The program book for downloading APPS in
your life is found in God's Word. The best part about these APPS is
they are FREE for the taking! You must take the time to initiate
them, but they are worth it! These APPS will not only show you how to
grow FAITH, but they correct the errors of life. WOW!! What a deal!
Hide God's Word in your heart today! It's profitable!
