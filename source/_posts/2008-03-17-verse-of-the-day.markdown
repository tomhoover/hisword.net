_Psalm 71:3  
Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort:
thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my
fortress._

Start your week off right! Powerful prayer finds its support in the
promises of God. When we base our prayers on what God has pledged
Himself to do, we stand on unshakable ground. Share God&rsquo;s touch
with others today.
