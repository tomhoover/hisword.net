_Mark 9:23  
Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible
to him that believeth._

As the man put an "if" on the power of Christ, Christ puts an "if"
on the faith of the man. Here is the thought. Oftentimes the power to
overcome sin or trials or to trust in the Biblical concept that "all
things work together for good to them that love God...," is not a
lack of power on God&rsquo;s part, but a lack of faith on ours. There
are many areas of our Christian pilgrimage that will not come to
fruition on their own, as they require the nurturing of our expressed
faith, in God's power, before He will perform it.
