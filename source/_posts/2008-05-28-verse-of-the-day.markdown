_Joshua 23:10  
One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it
is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you._

When God and you are on the same side, one of you is equal to a
thousand. In other words, God does BIG things for those who put their
trust and faith in Him. There is no reason for you to be overcome by
fear in any area of your life. You are mighty through God to
overcome! Believe it!
