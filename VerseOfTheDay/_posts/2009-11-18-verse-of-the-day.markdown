_Psalm 141:5  
Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him
reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my
head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities._

Kindness in our verse today is described as a good Christian
friend, who loves you so much, that they will tell you the truth,
even though it might not be pleasant to accept. If you should find
yourself in such a situation, be sure that you pray for God to help
your words to be spoken in a spirit of love and kindness. God's love
is powerful to change lives and impossible situations.
