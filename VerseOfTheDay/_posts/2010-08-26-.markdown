_Psalm 16:9  
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also
shall rest in hope._

You don't have to wait till you get to heaven to rejoice and be
glad! You've got some wonderful things in your life to rejoice about
right now. If Jesus Christ is in your heart, this is a possession
that can never be taken away from you. The worst thing that can
happen to you is death, and that is a promotion for the Christian.
Rejoice! HOPE has a name in this life and the life to come. It's
JESUS!
