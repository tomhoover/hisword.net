_I Timothy 5:8  
But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his
own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel._

The world often judges your FAITH by how you provide for others.
Now, is that fair? Well, yes, as a manner of fact, it is! If you have
FAITH in God, there is nothing that will be impossible for God to
provide. The problem is a lack of FAITH on the part of Christians.
All of us tend to look at ONLY what is in our hands. We forget that
it is God's hands that have provided everything that is in our hands.
We have no ownership over God's blessings in our lives. If God has
blessed you, it was given to you to pass along to someone else. But
what about the future? "If I don't store up my money, I'll starve
when I get old!" It's called FAITH! You give, and simply trust Him!
