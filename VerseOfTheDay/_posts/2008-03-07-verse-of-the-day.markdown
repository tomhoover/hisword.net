title: March 7th - God&rsquo;s Place of Promise
---

_Hebrews 8:6  
But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also
he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon
better promises._

The best promise God ever made was to give you a Savior, Jesus
Christ. It is through this promise that your eternity can be secured.
Place your trust in God&rsquo;s promises, as He guarantees a bright
future and wonderful day.
