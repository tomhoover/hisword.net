title: September 30th - Partnership with God in the Church

_Hebrews 6:10  
For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love,
which ye have showed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to
the saints, and do minister._

You just thought no one saw all the good things that you have done
for the Lord and others! God sees all your work and labors of love on
his behalf, and promises not to forget. He sees the anonymous gift for
the discouraged saint given in His name. He sees the countless deeds
you have funded out of your own pocket, for Him and others. He sees
your heart when you labor to give your very best for your church as
it's His church too. Don't be weary, pilgrim! Keep it up, soldier! It
will be worth it all! God sees and doesn't forget!
