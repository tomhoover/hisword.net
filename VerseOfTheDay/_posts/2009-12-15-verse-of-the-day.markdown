title: December 15th - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_Philippians 2:2  
Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being
of one accord, of one mind._

Someone is going to cross your path today who will need to see the
"joy of the Lord." Prepare your heart right now to have the
sensitivity to recognize those who need God's love. Christmas can be
a sad time for many. Get out of yourself and give encouragement to a
lonely soul.
