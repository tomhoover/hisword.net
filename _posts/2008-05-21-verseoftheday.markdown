title: May 21st - God&rsquo;s Place of Victory
---

_Isaiah 40:8  
The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God
shall stand for ever._

Have you already planned your day out? If you want it to be a good
day, stop and include God. God is the most absolute, concrete part of
your life. The jobs, people, issues, and daily needs, will all go
away, but God will still be there! Faithful - isn&rsquo;t that just
like God?
