title: September 23rd - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Luke 7:47  
Wherefore I say unto thee, her sins, which are many, are forgiven;
for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth
little._

If you feel that your sins are so great that God could never
forgive you, remember this: your forgiveness doesn't depend on your
worthiness, but on what Christ has done for you at the cross. God
loves you. Accept His love and claim a new beginning today.
