_John 6:28-29  
28 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the
works of God?  
29 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that
ye believe on him whom he hath sent._

What could your church do for God if everyone had the faith to
believe that God could and wants to do great things in it? You may
need to be the first one to step forward, and declare your belief in
God to do great things. Your Partner promises to do the work, when
you genuinely believe!
