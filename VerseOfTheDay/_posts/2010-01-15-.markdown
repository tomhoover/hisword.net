title: January 15th - Extreme Love...Is not proud or self-focused
---

_James 4:6  
But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the
proud, but giveth grace unto the humble._

God doesn't like for His children to be proud! What does pride look
like in our lives? Prideful people can't ever say they are wrong. They
have to defend their actions. Prideful people are too important to be
put out for others. They are better than others. Prideful people
don't have as many friends as the humble. They don't need friends.
Most of all, prideful people are short on grace. God gives His grace
to the humble. Need some grace today? Humble yourself before God.
