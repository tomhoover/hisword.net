_Jeremiah 15:16  
Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me
the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O
LORD God of hosts._

"Called by thy name." In the New Testament era, the Bible teaches
the priesthood of the believer. We are called by God and represent
Him as His children. Like an ambassador is responsible to speak for
the King of his country, we have the glorious privilege and the
awesome responsibility to speak for our King. To be a faithful
ambassador for Christ, we must know His will by knowing His Word.
Christian, feast on the Word as Jeremiah does here, and follow it
wherever it leads.
