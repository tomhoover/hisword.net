title: February 4th - Extreme Love...is gracious, not rude.
---

_I Peter 2:1-3  
Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
and envies, and all evil speakings, As newborn babes, desire the
sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: If so be ye have
tasted that the Lord is gracious._

Just when you thought you knew what being gracious to others was
all about, God says, "Grow some more!" This is part of the mystery of
grace, it meets you where you are, but it does not leave you like you
were before you experienced it. Every time you see God's grace in
your life, it should cause you to want to be more gracious in your
love, patience, tolerance, and speech, toward others. You will
forever be in debt to God's grace....get GROWING!
