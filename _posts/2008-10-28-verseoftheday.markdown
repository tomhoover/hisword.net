title: October 28th - The Basics of Partnership
---

_Psalm 139:9-10  
9 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost
parts of the sea;  
10 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold
me._

As you start this day, take this mental picture of God's presence
with you. If you went to the highest place in the sky or down to the
lowest part of the sea, there is no place where God's hand is not
there with you. Just in case you might feel insecure, His other hand
is there to protect you and hold you safe in His care. God gives you
BOTH His hands in this partnership! He goes beyond all human
comprehension....that's your Almighty God!
