_Psalm 17:15  
As for me, I will behold Thy face in righteousness: I shall be
satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness._

As a Christian our goal is to become more and more like our Savior
Jesus Christ. While we are in this present body there will always be
a struggle to do right. That means every day we must renew our
attitudes and commitment to Him, and never stop aspiring to be like
Him, until we see His face! What about you? Will you be Jesus to
someone today?
