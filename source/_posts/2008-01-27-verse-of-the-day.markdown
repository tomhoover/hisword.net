_Psalm 28:7  
The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and
I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song
will I praise him._

Did you do it? Did you leave home without your shield? God's shield
of faith, will reflect the darts of the enemy. It's not too late.
Prayerfully put it on, and your song and praise will return!
