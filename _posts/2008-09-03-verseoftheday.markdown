title: September 3rd - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Psalm 51:1  
Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
transgressions._

Someone said, "We forgive to the extent that we love." When you ask
God to forgive your sins, He loves you so much, He not only forgives
you, but uses a big eraser to totally remove the record of it. God's
love challenges all of us to examine our prejudices, when forgiving
others. It can be equally said, "According to the extent of your love
for God, you will forgive others."
