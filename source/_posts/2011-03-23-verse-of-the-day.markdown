_Hebrews 11:37-39  
They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain
with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins;
being destitute, afflicted, tormented; (Of whom the world was not
worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and
caves of the earth. And these all, having obtained a good report
through faith, received not the promise._

There were some wonderful Christians who lived before you. The
world was not worthy of them! They suffered and died to defend their
FAITH. Don't think that this kind of FAITH is all in the past. God is
still recording the lives of those who have FAITH! Will you be among
them?
