title: January 19th - Partnership with God in Daily Disciplines

_Isaiah 40:29  
He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he
increaseth strength._

Okay, it's Monday! You are tired, and if it were not for God, you
might be weak and give into your fleshly desires. With that in mind,
stop and ask God to renew your mind and body to keep the commitments
of your heart. It's going to be a great day with God's help!
