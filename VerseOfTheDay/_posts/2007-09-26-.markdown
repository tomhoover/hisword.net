_Isaiah 61:1  
The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath
anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to
bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and
the opening of the prison to them that are bound._

This speaks of Jesus' first coming. He came to give the believer
freedom from the bondage and dominion of sin! This glorious message
is amplified by Paul. "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal
body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye
your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield
yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your
members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall not
have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under
grace" (Rom 6:12-14).
