title: December 18th - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_I John 4:21  
And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love
his brother also._

Love is shown in many different ways this time of the year. Some
say it's when you take the time to purchase a gift for someone.
Others say it's when you give of your time to be with family. God
says, "You don't love Him, unless you love your brother." Get out of
yourself and love the unlovely, unlikely, and unsaved. That's
Christmas love!
