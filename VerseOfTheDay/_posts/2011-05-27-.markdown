title: May 27th - FaithSearch...examining your Faith in the midst of life's
---

_Proverbs 12:15  
The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth
unto counsel is wise._

Nobody has everything nailed down! You are a fool if you think you
know it all! In our verse today, you are encouraged to seek the
counsel of wise people. You can learn some wonderful truths from the
lives of FAITH FULL saints who have gone before you. Call an older
Christian today and spend some time with them! You will bless them,
and yourself!
