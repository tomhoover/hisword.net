_Philippians 3:10  
That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the
fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his
death._

God&rsquo;s place of promise included an empty tomb. Everything
happened just like He said it would. Every promise that God made
concerning Jesus&rsquo; birth, death, and resurrection have come
true! You can build your life on God&rsquo;s promises!
