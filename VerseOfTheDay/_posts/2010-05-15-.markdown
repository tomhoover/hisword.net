title: May 15th - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.
---

_Luke 6:37  
Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not
be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven._

Anybody need some understanding and forgiveness today? God's Word
says that if you want people to be understanding of your
imperfections, you must be understanding of theirs. Don't be quick to
judge others as you are looking at the surface, not the heart. Judging
is a "thought process." When judgmental thoughts come to your mind,
disqualify yourself, and remember you are also a forgiven sinner.
Extreme LOVE thinks no evil.
