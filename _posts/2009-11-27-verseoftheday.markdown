title: November 27th - Extreme Love...Is Kind
---

_Matthew 5:44  
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do
good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use
you, and persecute you._

Have you prayed for those people who trouble you, today? One of the
kindest things we can do for people who we have trouble with, is to
pray for them. Pray that God will bless them and help them to see
your love for them. Pray that you will have a good attitude toward
them at all times. Prayer changes lives! Believe it!
