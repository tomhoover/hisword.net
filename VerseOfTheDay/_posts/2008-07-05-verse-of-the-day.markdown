_II Corinthians 7:10  
For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented
of: but the sorrow the world worketh death._

Sorrow with repentance brings change. Sorrow without repentance
brings nothing. If you want your day to be productive, ask God to
forgive your sin and change your life in a way that would bring Him
honor and glory.
