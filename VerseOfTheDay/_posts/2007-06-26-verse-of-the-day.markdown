_I Corinthians 10:13  
There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man:
but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that
ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape,
that ye may be able to bear._

This precious verse of comfort and strength is a reminder that God
is not only on the up side, but He is very present in the down side
as well. Whether it is temptation from this world and its prince, or
testing in trial from God, He is with you on the mountain top, in the
valley, and everywhere in between.
