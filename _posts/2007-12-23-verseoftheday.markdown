title: December 23rd - God's Place of Provision
---

_Matthew 1:21  
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS:
for he shall save his people from their sins._

God has made a provision for every need in your life. Jesus left
the splendor of heaven to be a sacrifice for you. Will you leave the
comfort of your home to serve Him today?
