_Luke 2:10-11  
And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you
good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you
is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the
Lord._

Talk about FAITH! Can you imagine how bright the "glory of the
Lord" must be? It had to be blinding! Yet God knows that it takes
"the spectacular" to get man's attention sometimes. It's not everyday
that a Savior is born who will die for the sins of the world. Thank
you, God, for sending the BEST thing in heaven down to this earth!
You, LORD, are spectacular, and we celebrate Your Son!
