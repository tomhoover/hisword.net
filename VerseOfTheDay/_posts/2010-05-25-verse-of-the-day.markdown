_Matthew 5:44  
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do
good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use
you, and persecute you._

When was the last time you showed your "love" (compassion and
understanding) to that difficult person in your life? When was the
last time you "blessed" (said kind things) about that difficult
someone in your life? When was the last time you did a "good deed"
(helped) that difficult person in your life? When was the last time
you "prayed" (specifically) for that difficult someone in your life?
Sounds like TODAY is a good day to begin!
