title: February 23rd - Extreme Love...is gracious, not rude.
---

_I John 4:7  
Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one
that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God._

If you have been loved by God, then you are commanded to love one
another. When you give your heart to Jesus Christ, God's love is born
in your heart. You have been given a great gift, and you are obligated
to share it with others. Who will it be today? That's the exciting
part about being a Christian, you just never know who God has planned
to bring into your life on any given day. Be prepared! God's made an
appointment for you today!
