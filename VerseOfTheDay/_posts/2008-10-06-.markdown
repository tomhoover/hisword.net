title: October 6th - The Basics of Partnership
---

_I Corinthians 15:58  
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your
labour is not in vain in the Lord._

It&rsquo;s Monday! Don't be discouraged if your work is not
appreciated by the world. When God is your partner and you are
faithful to do your work unto Him, He will reward you. This is just
one of those great benefits of working with God!
