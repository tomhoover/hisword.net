title: March 18th - God&rsquo;s Place of Promise
---

_II Corinthians 5:14-15  
14 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge,
that if one died for all, then were all dead:  
15 And that he died for all, that they which live should not
henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them,
and rose again._

Love is something that must be given away. Look for someone today
to whom you can show God&rsquo;s love. God gave you His best. What
can you give to others?
