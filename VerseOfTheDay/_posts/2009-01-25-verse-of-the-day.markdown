_Psalm 30:10  
Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou my helper._

Is this just another Sunday for you? Will you sing directing your
words unto the God of your salvation? Will you personalize the
pastor's message, and hear what God wants to tell you? Will you
respond when the Holy Spirit moves on your heart? This could be just
another Sunday, or it could be different, if you call upon the Lord
in mercy and ask Him to help you focus on Him.
