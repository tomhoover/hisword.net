_Psalm 119:135  
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy
statutes._

Permit me a paraphrase. Make thy loving favor to set thy servant's
heart on fire. Let me know says the Psalmist, by the testimony of thy
Spirit in my conscience, that thou art reconciled to me. The godly in
all ages derived their happiness from a consciousness of the Divine
favor. The witness of God&rsquo;s Spirit in the souls of believers is
essential to a believer's well being.
