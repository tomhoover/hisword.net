_II Chronicles 29:11a  
My sons, be not now negligent: for the Lord hath chosen you to stand
before Him, to serve Him._

No one can do, what only you were made to do, for God. We can think
that the only people God uses are those who teach or sing. That is
just two areas, out of unlimited actions, that can be used for God.
You have some gifts that God purposely gave you that are unique to
meet the needs of someone searching for meaning in life. Don't be
negligent, God has an agenda for you today!
