title: March 4th - Extreme Love...is giving.
---

_Acts 20:35b  
Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more
blessed to give than to receive._

"Extreme Love" sees the world through a different set of glasses!
If you would look closely into the eyes of a hurting person, you
might just see Jesus Christ staring back at you. Then when you go a
step further and meet their needs out of your own provisions, you
might just see Jesus smile back at you. Ask God to give you eyes to
see people and respond to them as Jesus would. Put on your "love
glasses" and "give in Jesus name."
