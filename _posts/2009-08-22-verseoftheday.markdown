_Ephesians 3:19  
And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye
might be filled with all the fullness of God._

All of humanity longs to be loved. If you have Christ in your
heart, you are blessed with the most wonderful love of all. His love
is expressed through provision of your needs, direction of your life,
and best of all, salvation of your soul. Just think....... He will
love you through eternity...........!!
