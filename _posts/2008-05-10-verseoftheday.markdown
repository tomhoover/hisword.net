title: May 10th - God&rsquo;s Place of Victory
---

_Isaiah 25:8  
He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away
tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take
away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it._

Do you cry about the right things?
&ldquo;Unbelief begins weeping for the funeral before the man is
dead; why should not faith commence piping before the dance of
victory begins?&rdquo;- Charles H. Spurgeon
Ask God to give you tears for the lost who don&rsquo;t know about
the victory of salvation in Jesus Christ, and may you rejoice in the
victories you already possess.
