_Isaiah 18:3  
All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye,
when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a
trumpet, hear ye._

Hello, earthling!! God is trying to get your attention. He can use
road delays, money matters, and health issues. If you bow the knee
and give Him some of your time, He might not have to shout so loud!
