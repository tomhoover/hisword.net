_Galatians 6:10  
As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,
especially unto them who are of the household of faith._

Many times we make a false supposition that Christians shouldn't
need encouragement. If you are a Christian, you know that is not
true. If you have unmet needs in your life, the best way to have them
met, is to give the very thing you need in your life to another
Christian. It is when you forget yourself and give, that God most
often opens heaven's windows and showers down His blessings. Ask God
to give you the face or name of a fellow Christian who needs a "good"
word of encouragement.
