title: December 11th - Partnership with God in Personal Finances

_Hebrews 13:5  
Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with
such things as ye have: for He hath said, I will never leave thee,
nor forsake thee._

Everybody likes to talk about a sale or a bargain this time of the
year. Salvation is still the best bargain out there. Ask God to help
you be content with what you have, and thank God for the treasure of
His Presence in your life.
