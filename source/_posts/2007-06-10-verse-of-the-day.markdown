_John 14:1  
Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in
me._

Jesus was going away, ultimately back to His Father in heaven.
Jesus would comfort them, however, with the promise that He would
prepare a place for them in His Father's house and would come back to
move them in. In fact, Jesus loves us so much that He meets with us
now in our church body. This is what Jesus meant when He told the
Eleven apostles minus Judas, */"I will not leave you comfortless: I
will come to you."/* In the person of the Holy Spirit, Jesus Himself
is with us.
