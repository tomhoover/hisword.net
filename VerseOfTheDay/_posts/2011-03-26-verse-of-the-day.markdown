title: March 26th - FaithLine...building upon the line of Faith set before

_Psalm 89:1  
I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will
I make known thy faithfulness to all generations._

Someone said, "If you have a song of FAITH in your heart, it will
be heard by the look on your face." In other words, you will share
your FAITH through your actions and deeds, with those around you. It
could be your family, friends, or neighbors who are looking to see
your FAITH. Do you have a song in your heart? There is someone who
needs to hear it!
