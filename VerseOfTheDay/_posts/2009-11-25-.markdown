title: November 25th - Extreme Love...Is Kind
---

_Isaiah 63:7  
I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of
the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the
great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on
them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his
lovingkindnesses._

It's time to speak up and praise the Lord! Wherever you go today,
when you recognize God's blessings in your life, praise His name
audibly. This is a small thing to do, to glorify God, in light of all
the loving kindnesses He has done on your behalf. Take the "Praise
Challenge," and speak up for the LORD today!
