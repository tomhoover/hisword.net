_John 8:12  
Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the
world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall
have the light of life._

Someone said, "A smile is the light in the window of your face that
tells people you are at home." Our verse says that when you walk with
Jesus, LIGHT will be seen in your life. What does that LIGHT look
like? It could be a smile, an encouraging word, or a deed of
kindness. Make the most of your life, and don't waste a precious
moment! Follow the LIGHT and stay away from the darkness!
