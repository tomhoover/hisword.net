title: April 17th- God&rsquo;s Place of Care
---

_II Corinthians 6:18  
And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
daughters, saith the Lord Almighty._

Living in the midst of a sinful, cursed world, it&rsquo;s hard to
imagine being in the Creator of the world&rsquo;s family. If you have
asked Jesus into your heart, you are a brother or sister to Him! This
relationship means God cares about everything in your life. How will
that change your life today?
