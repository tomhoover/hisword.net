title: April 1st - FaithLift...challenging your Faith through the power of
---

_Philippians 3:10  
That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the
fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his
death._

Traditionally the first day of April is called "April's Fools Day!"
The truly foolish person is the one who lives their lives unto
themselves and not unto God. You are foolish if you spend your life
pursuing pleasures over a relationship with Jesus Christ. Knowing
Christ will require a sacrifice of your time and resources. Don't be
foolish! Life isn't about having to spend time with God, it's about
wanting to spend time with God. The "POWER" of God is revealed in the
lives of those who KNOW Him!
Do you need to get to KNOW HIM better? Faith Lift!
