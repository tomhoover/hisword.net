_Ephesians 4:32  
And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you._

Someone said, "Forgiveness is like spinach...you might not like the
taste, but it's good for you." It can be hard to face the fact that no
one is perfect, and that includes you. Everyone offends someone at
sometime. How can you withhold forgiveness when you need it so badly
in your life, also? Christ kindly and tenderly forgives you over and
over. It may not be fun, but kindly forgiving someone is good for
you, and the other person!
