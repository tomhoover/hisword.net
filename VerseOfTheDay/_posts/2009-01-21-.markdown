title: January 21st - Partnership with God in Daily Disciplines

_II Timothy 2:3  
Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ._

Be strong today, and keep yourself focused on your commander Jesus
Christ! George Washington was leading the army during a very
difficult time, and he made this observation: /"Nothing can be more
hurtful to the service, than the neglect of discipline; for that
discipline, more than numbers, gives one army the superiority over
the other."/
