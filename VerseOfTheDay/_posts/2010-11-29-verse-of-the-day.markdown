_Psalm 32:7  
Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou
shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah._

FAITHFUL! That is one of many descriptions of the Almighty God! It
is the word that gives Christians hope and encouragement in the midst
of this sinful world. Your eternal salvation depends upon it! It means
you can count on GOD! If He went to such pains to create a perfect
environment for life and gave His Son for the sins of the world, you
better know He is active in sustaining it! GOD is alive and involved
in your life! May your FAITH grow stronger every day as you live in
His FAITHFULNESS.
