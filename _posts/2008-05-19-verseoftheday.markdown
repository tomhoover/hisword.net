_Isaiah 51:16  
And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the
shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the
foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people._

Does your mouth ever get you in trouble? As you start your day, let
this verse be your prayer. &ldquo;God, put Your words in my mouth, and
cover me with Your hand, the all powerful hand, that created me and
the world, that I might have the power and boldness to tell someone
about You&rdquo;. Share God with someone today.
