title: April 9th - Partnership with God for a Victorious Life
---

_Isaiah 25:8  
He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away
tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take
away from off all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it._

The Old Testament believers looked forward to the day when a Savior
would come and conquer death. You can read in your Bible how that
Jesus Christ is that Savior. Death has been conquered for those who
have given their heart to Jesus Christ. God offers this great gift of
"victory over the grave," to you and all the world. Do you believe?
Let others see it on your face today.
