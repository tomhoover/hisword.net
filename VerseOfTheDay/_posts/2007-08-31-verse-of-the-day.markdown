_Luke 6:38  
Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down,
and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your
bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be
measured to you again._

Almost all ancient nations wore long, wide, and loose garments; and
when about to carry anything which their hands could not contain, they
used a fold of their robe in nearly the same way as someone today uses
an apron. The principle of life here is that we reap what we sow. It
is a law of life that few understand. Whether it be physically,
emotionally, socially or spiritually, you receive in abundance from a
multiple variety of giving sources when you freely give of who you are
and all you have.
