title: April 16th - Extreme Love...works at overcoming anger.
---

_Proverbs 19:11  
The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to
pass over a transgression._

Does it serve any purpose to point out the faults of others? This
is where Godly discretion must be used in our lives. When you chose
to talk to the Lord about it, instead of angrily confronting someone,
you can be sure God will do what you cannot do. Your words could be
misunderstood, but when God corrects a wrong, He handles it in the
best way possible. It's just better to let God change people and
situations. He doesn't mess up! Give it to God, and be sure to give
Him the glory when things change!
