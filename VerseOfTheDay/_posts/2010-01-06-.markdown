title: January 6th - Extreme Love...Is not proud or self-focused
---

_I Corinthians 10:33  
Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit,
but the profit of many, that they may be saved._

Jesus Christ left the wealth of heaven, to touch the life of the
poor, that they might be rich in salvation, through faith in Him.
What is that in comparison to the small things that you are asked to
give up so that others might be saved? Ask God to show you where you
can sacrifice to make a difference in the life of someone else.
