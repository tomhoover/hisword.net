_Psalm 16:11  
Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of
joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore._

Your path today could cross the life of someone who desperately
needs hope and joy. If you have "joy" on your face, it could make the
difference. Be prepared to share your faith and the hope of eternity
you have through Jesus Christ.
