_I Corinthians 4:2  
Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful._

It&rsquo;s Monday! You have a whole week ahead of you. As you are
making your &ldquo;To Do&rdquo; list for the week? Be sure to plan
some time for God. Be faithful to include an alone time with Him
every day. It will help your week go better!
