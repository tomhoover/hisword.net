_Psalm 90:17  
And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us: and establish
thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands
establish thou it._

You may think that the disciplines of the Christian life are hard
work, but it is a small thing when you hear God say that your work is
beautiful in His eyes! The beautiful thing about working for the Lord
is that your life can bring honor and glory to God in this life and
the life to come. You are a beautiful, faithful Christian, keep
working!
