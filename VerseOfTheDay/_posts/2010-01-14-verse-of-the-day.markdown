_I Corinthians 10:31  
Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to
the glory of God._

Now that is an EXTREME VERSE!! What a challenge! Can you imagine
how much our lives would change if the motive for everything we did
was to glorify God? We would probably lose some weight! We would
probably watch what we say a lot more! We would probably do more for
others and less for ourselves! We would probably get a lot more work
done and less play!
God speak to each of us today and help us be more mindful to bring
glory to Your name!
