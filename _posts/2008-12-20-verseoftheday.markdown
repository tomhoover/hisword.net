title: December 20th - Partnership with God in Personal Finances

_Luke 1:45  
And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance
of those things which were told her from the Lord._

Mary, the Mother of Jesus, had a close relationship with her God.
She believed all the seemingly impossible things that God told her
would happen. Oh, that you could have such faith! What could you do
for God today, if you truly believed God was with you and wanted to
use you? Listen for His voice today.
