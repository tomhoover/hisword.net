_Isaiah 12:2  
Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for
the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; He also is become my
salvation._

Isn&rsquo;t it great to know that you don&rsquo;t have to live this
life alone? If you have asked Jesus Christ into your heart, you have
the Savior to help you through life. God is our salvation and
continues to be our salvation through the trials of life. Call unto
Him right now, He longs to have a relationship with you.
