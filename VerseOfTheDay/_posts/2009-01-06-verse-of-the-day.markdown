_John 13:17  
If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them._

Do you know how to be happy today? If you will just discipline your
life to do the things that you know pleases God, it will make for a
happy day. Don't forget that there are some things you were never
meant to carry. Give your burdens to God and this will restore your
smile.
