title: February 18th - Extreme Love...is gracious, not rude.
---

_Psalm 18:1  
I will love thee, O LORD, my strength._

Love is still the thing that God wants most from you, and it's
interesting that it is love for God that will bring you the most
strength in your life. It is only when you are weak that He can
become strong on your behalf. It's only when you are lovingly
clinging to Him, understanding that you are nothing in yourself, that
He can give you strength. Do you need some strength to get through
your day? Fall on your knees and pour out your love to God.
