_I Thessalonians 1:3  
Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love,
and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God
and our Father._

Will you be remembered for having "patience" or for being
"impatient"? You are either one or the other. If you don't know
which, ask someone else to tell you which you are. Better yet, you
could just ask God to reveal it. May your patience grow in the sight
of mankind and your heavenly Father.
