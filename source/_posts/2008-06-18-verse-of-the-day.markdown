_Psalm 16:11  
Thou wilt shew me the path of life: In thy presence is fullness of
joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore._

How&rsquo;s the day looking? Does it look like it&rsquo;s going to
be joyful or just another dreary day? Spend some time in the presence
of the Lord and it just might make you smile and you might actually
enjoy your day! :
