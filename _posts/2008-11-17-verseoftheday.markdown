title: November 17th - Partnership with God in Prayer
---

_Joel 2:32a  
And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon the name
of the Lord shall be delivered._

There are many people in this world looking for a reason to live.
Someone will probably cross your path today who doesn't know about
the saving power of Jesus Christ. If more Christians really cared
about something other than themselves, lives would be changed and our
churches would be different. Would you pray for God to give you a
burden, an opportunity and the boldness to share Jesus Christ with
someone today? Your Partner will help you!
