title: December 24th - God's Place of Provision
---

_Matthew 1:23  
Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,
and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is,
God with us._

This is usually a very busy day for families. You will have to work
hard to remember that Emmanuel, God is with you. Make room for Him at
the center of your celebrations.
