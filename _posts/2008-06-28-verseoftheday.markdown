title: June 28th - God&rsquo;s Place of Peace
---

_Romans 12:18  
If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all
men._

There is not one perfect human being upon this earth! That&rsquo;s
a relief, as it takes the pressure off you. God wants you to try to
get along with other people as much as possible, however. You need to
&ldquo;make peace&rdquo; in your own heart with difficult people, or
else it can grow into bitterness. You need to keep your heart in a
position where it could reconcile with anyone, when they give you the
nod. Ask God to help you keep your heart, today!
