_Galatians 6:2  
Bear ye one another&rsquo;s burdens, and so fulfil the law of
Christ._

Do you know anyone who has a burden or problems that seem
overwhelming? As God gives you a name and a face, plan right now to
do something that would lighten their load. Don't just think about
doing it, ask your Partner to help you actually make a difference
today in the life of somebody else!
