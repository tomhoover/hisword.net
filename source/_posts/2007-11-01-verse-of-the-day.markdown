_Exodus 15:26  
And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD
thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give
ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none
of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians:
for I am the LORD that healeth thee._

Do you have health insurance? God's policy is the only one that
provides complete coverage for a broken heart and body. What an
awesome God we serve!
