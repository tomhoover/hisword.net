title: February 20th - Partnership with God in Loving Relationships
---

_I John 3:11  
For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we
should love one another._

One of the strongest indications that you are a child of God is
revealed when you can show love to those who are seemingly
unloveable. If you had to choose one thing that you could do today to
please God, choose to "love" everyone in your path. This will really
make your Partner happy.
