title: July 9th - God&rsquo;s Place of Salvation
---

_Psalm 62:7  
In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my
refuge, is in God._

When God saves you from a difficult situation today, make sure you
give Him the glory. David mentions God&rsquo;s name twice in this
passage. He wants to make sure that everyone knows it was GOD who
delivered him.
