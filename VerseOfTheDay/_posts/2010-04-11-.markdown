_Matthew 5:23-24  
Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest
that thy brother hath ought against thee; Leave there thy gift before
the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and
then come and offer thy gift._

God is really doing you a great favor when He tells you to forgive
others before you come to Him. Unforgiveness is like plaque in an
artery. It eventually stops the blood flow, and a heart attack
follows. Every commandment that God gives you, He gives knowing what
you need for living this life at it's best. Do you really want to
cause a break in your relationship with God? Forgive those who have
provoked you.
