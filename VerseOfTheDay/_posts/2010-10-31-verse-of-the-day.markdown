_Romans 10:10  
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the
mouth confession is made unto salvation._

FAITH Challenge: Speak FAITH in every situation throughout your
entire day!
Can you do it? This is a huge challenge for anyone, but YOU can do
it! Jesus said that out of the abundance of your heart your mouth
speaks. Therefore, if you are going to be able to pass this
challenge, you will have to prepare your heart. Ask God to fill you
with FAITH! Believe it and speak it! FAITH FULL!
