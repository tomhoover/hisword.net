title: April 29th - Extreme Love...works at overcoming anger.
---

_Proverbs 17:9  
He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth
a matter separateth very friends._

When you love someone, sometimes you just need to keep some things
to yourself. When you foolishly tell others about an offense, it can
cause great harm. Instead of seeking self justification, take it to
the Lord in prayer. Extreme love will suffer personal loss rather
than hurt the reputation of a friend. Friends in Christ are to be
cherished, not slandered.
