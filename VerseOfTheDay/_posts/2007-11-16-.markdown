title: November 16th - God's Place of Healing
---

_Malachi 4:2  
But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise
with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as
calves of the stall._

God can take your afflictions and turn them into something
beautiful when you give them to Him. If you keep them to yourself,
you will never learn to fly and soar with God.
