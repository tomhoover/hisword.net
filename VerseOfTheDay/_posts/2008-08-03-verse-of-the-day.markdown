_Hebrews 11:6  
But without faith it is impossible to please Him: for he that cometh
to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that
diligently seek Him._

You must decide if you are going to put your faith and trust in God
and His Word, or have faith in only what you can physically see. The
&ldquo;eye of faith&rdquo; sees God as real and alive dwelling among
us. If you take this mental picture of God being with you today, you
will be blessed!
