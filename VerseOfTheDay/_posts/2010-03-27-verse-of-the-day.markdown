_Romans 8:28  
And we know that all things work together for good to them that love
God, to them who are the called according to his purpose._

The key to this verse lies in the phrase, "to them that love God."
When you truly love God, you have the mind set that all things really
do happen for your good. You come to trust God's purpose and plan for
your life, knowing that whatever happens in your life, it will be not
only for your good, but His good. Just love God," today, and leave the
details up to Him!
