_Ezekiel 34:12  
As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his
sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will
deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the
cloudy and dark day._

Because of their continued rebellion and disobedience, God had the
Romans besiege Jerusalem and Israel around 70AD and scattered His
nation throughout the nations of the earth. In 1948 Israel became a
nation again which is an exciting indicator that the Day of the Lord
is near, which is highlighted by the return of Jesus Christ as King
who will rule and reign over the earth from Jerusalem, and at that
day Israel will be delivered forever to dwell in safety along with
all of God&rsquo;s children by faith in Jesus Christ.
