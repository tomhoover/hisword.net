_James 4:14  
Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your
life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then
vanisheth away._

Life is short, therefore you need to make every day count. You can
spend the day doing things that would bring you pleasure, or things
that would bring God glory. Purpose today that you will begin by
asking God to guide you to do the things that would bring Him honor
and glory. That's how you make your day profitable!
