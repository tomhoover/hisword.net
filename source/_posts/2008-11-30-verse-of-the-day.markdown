_Matthew 6:6  
But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou
hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy
Father which seeth in secret, shall reward you openly._

Are there times when you pray to God in secret? Secret prayers are
prayer requests that you share with no one else but God. Some of
Jesus' harshest words were to people who were praying to get the
praise of others. When God hears your secret prayer and openly
answers, He gets the glory and it's just one more thing that makes
your partnership with Him a little stronger and sweeter!
