_II Timothy 1:7  
For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
love, and of a sound mind._

If "fear" doesn't come from God, then it must not be good for you!
If those thoughts of "fear" come up in your mind today, remember your
verse. God's given you His power, His love, and His sound mind! This
is good for you, and will ensure a good day! Think right!
