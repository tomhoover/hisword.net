title: August 19th - God&rsquo;s Place of Faithfulness
---

_Luke 16:12  
And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another
man&rsquo;s, who shall give you that which is your own?_

God uses various ways to encourage us to &ldquo;love our
neighbor&rdquo; throughout His word. Help someone reach their dream
today, and it will put you one step closer to fulfilling your own
dreams and desires. You never help someone else without it ultimately
helping you.
