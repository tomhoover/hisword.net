_Psalm 31:3  
For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake
lead me, and guide me._

In our verse, David has come to a point in his life where he is
putting his whole trust in God to guide and care for him. He is
learning that God alone, is the Rock, the most secure possession in
his life. May you embrace that same truth, today! It will make the
journey more enjoyable!
