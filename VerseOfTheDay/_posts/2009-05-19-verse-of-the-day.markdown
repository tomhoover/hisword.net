_James 4:11  
Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of
his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and
judgeth the law; but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of
the law, but a judge._

Living in this world, where most people speak their opinions about
other people, many Christians can become judgmental. We are not to be
like everyone else. Our attitudes should be different. Jesus said to
pray for people instead of pointing out their faults. Stop and ask
God to help you be the person you should be, and let Him judge
others.
