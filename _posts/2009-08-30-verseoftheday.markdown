title: August 30th - Partnership with God for a Changed Life
---

_I Corinthians 15:52  
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and
we shall be changed._

You may not like change now, but there will be a day when it will
be wonderful! You will have a new body, and the pains and aches will
be all gone! That is hard to imagine, but there is a great day
coming! Get happy!
