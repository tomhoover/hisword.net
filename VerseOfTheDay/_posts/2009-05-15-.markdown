title: May 15th - Partnership with God in Attitude and Mind-Set
---

_I Thessalonians 5:18  
In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ
Jesus concerning you._

There is a Swedish Proverb that says, /"Those who wish to sing,
always find a song."/ If you have an attitude of thankfulness, you
will find something in every situation for which you are thankful.
Your attitude and mind-set determines if you are going to sing a
song, or sit and cry. You can't control the things that come your
way, but you can control your attitude. Find a song and sing it
today!
