_Ephesians 4:26  
Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath._

You've got till the sun goes down to get it out of your heart!!
That's right, you've got a time limit on your anger. If you don't
confess your sin, and get over it, it will grow into something that
will be much harder to deal with tomorrow. Be wise and get over it!
