title: October 27th - The Basics of Partnership
---

_Proverbs 3:6  
In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths._

It&rsquo;s Monday! You know what that means....you are going to
need some extra help to stay focused and get back into the workplace
routine. You need the love and direction of the Senior Partner. There
is a direct line from His heart to yours, access it.
