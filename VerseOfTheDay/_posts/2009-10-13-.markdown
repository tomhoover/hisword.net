title: October 13th - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_James 1:2-3  
My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience._

Are you happy that you have trials in your life? It's probably not
something you would ask God to give you, but it is profitable for
your life. Trials come with an expiration date, therefore they will
come to an end. At the end of your trial, can you say that your faith
resulted in developing more patience in your life? If so, then you can
rejoice, knowing that something good came out of your trial.
