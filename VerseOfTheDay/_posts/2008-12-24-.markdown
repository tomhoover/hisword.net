_Matthew 1:23  
Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,
and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is,
God with us._

You are living in a very privileged time period. People who loved
and served God in the Old Testament, more than anything, longed to
see the promises of God fulfilled. They wanted to see and know about
God's Son. You have been given the complete story in the written
Word. Today, He dwells with believers, as His name Emmanuel says.
Have you taken your privileged position for granted? You are so
blessed!
