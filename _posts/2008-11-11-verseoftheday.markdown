title: November 11th - Partnership with God in Prayer
---

_Matthew 6:9-10  
9 After this manner, therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
heaven, hallowed be Thy name.  
10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven._

When you pray, do you take the time to visualize to Whom you are
praying? If you understand that He is the definition for all holiness
and wisdom, it will demand two responses of you. First, you will
humbly praise Him for just who He is, and second, as you understand
He is the source of all wisdom, you will desire that His will be done
in earth and heaven.
