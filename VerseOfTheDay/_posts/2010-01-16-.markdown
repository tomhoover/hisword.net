title: January 16th - Extreme Love...Is not proud or self-focused
---

_Romans 15:1  
We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak,
and not to please ourselves._

God, in His infinite wisdom, has put opposites together to bring a
proper balance to life. In this verse we see that God gives strength
to some, not just for their own good, but so they can help those who
are weak. If you are strong, there is someone who needs your help
today. If you are weak, pray for God to send a brother who can help
share your load. Are you the strong or the weak? God's EXTREME LOVE
brings balance to both!
