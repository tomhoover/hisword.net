_Galatians 3:26  
For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus._

Not everyone upon this earth is a child of God. Our verse tells us
that all those who have put their FAITH and trust in Jesus Christ
become His children. As a child of God, you enjoy special privileges
that the rest of the world knows nothing about. God is your Father,
and He loves, protects and provides for you. You can enter your
Father's presence anytime you want, because you are His child. FAITH
brings a powerful relationship into the lives of those who believe.
Take a moment and thank your heavenly Father for the family benefits
of FAITH!
