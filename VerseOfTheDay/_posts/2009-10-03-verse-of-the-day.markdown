title: October 3rd - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_Ecclesiastes 7:8  
Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof; and the
patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit._

Most of God's people will never know much about earthly riches and
luxury, however, there is coming a day when all that will change for
the child of God. As you humbly and patiently wait for heaven's
future rewards, be encouraged to serve your LORD faithfully and do
what you can, while you can!
