_Philippians 2:5  
Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus._

Abraham Lincoln said, "I do not think much of a man who is not
wiser today than he was yesterday." We should all be working to
improve our minds, especially in spiritual matters. Learning the
"mind of Jesus Christ" should be a lifetime pursuit for every
Christian. What do you know today about the "mind of Jesus" that you
didn't know yesterday? Your assignment has been given. Get busy and
when you find it, apply it to your life today!
