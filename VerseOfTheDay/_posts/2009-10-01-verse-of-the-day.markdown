_I Corinthians 13:4a  
Charity suffereth long..._

Do you have a situation or a person in your life that is pushing
your patience to the limit? Consider this as a personal challenge
from God to go the extra mile, rather than just give up. You will
never see God's power in your life, if you give up when things are
tough! Ask God to fill you with HIS Extreme LOVE and you will be more
patient!
