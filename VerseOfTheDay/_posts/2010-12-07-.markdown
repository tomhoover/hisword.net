_John 1:6-7  
There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came
for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him
might believe._

God used John to tell others of a coming LIGHT that would change
lives. Those who are Believers today are given the same assignment.
The LIGHT of the world, Jesus, is coming again one day! We've got to
get the "Good News" out! May your LIGHT SHINE for Jesus today!
