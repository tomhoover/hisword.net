_I Corinthians 15:19  
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most
miserable._

Thomas Watson said, "We are more sure to arise out of our graves
than out of our beds." He is illustrating that nothing in this life
is certain. HOPE based upon Jesus Christ, the only One who has
conquered death and the grave, is solid HOPE! Don't put your trust in
your money, your abilities, or your friends and family. All will fail
you. HOPE in Christ, the only solid HOPE that goes beyond the
grave.
