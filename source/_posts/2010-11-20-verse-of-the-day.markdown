_II Timothy 2:15  
Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not
to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth._

You can't APPLY God's wisdom to your life, if you don't know it! On
the other hand, you might have studied your Bible all your life and
you might think you know all there is to know about living the
Christian life. That's the exciting thing about FAITH! If you have a
desire to grow and be more, you will never cease to learn new and
exciting things from God's Word. Read your Bible today, and ask God
to show you how to APPLY FAITH to your life in a new and fresh way!
