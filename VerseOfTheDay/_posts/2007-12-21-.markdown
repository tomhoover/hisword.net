_Titus 2:11  
For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
men._

j "Joy to the world, the Lord is come, let earth receive her king,
let every heart prepare Him room...." l Sing this song as you go
through the day and reflect on the grace of God that brought
salvation and joy to your heart.
