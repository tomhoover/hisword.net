_Philippians 3:13  
Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing
I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth
unto those things which are before._

A whole year has gone by. WOW! Take a few minutes to look back over
your life and reflect upon what God has done for you this past year.
There may be some things you would like to forget about 2009. There
are probably some lessons you learned that need to remembered and
carried into the new year. Stop and ask God to give you a fresh
vision of His Extreme Love. Nothing will motivate you to be a better
Christian more than LOVE. May you "fall in love" with Jesus again,
and do great and mighty things for Him in 2010!
