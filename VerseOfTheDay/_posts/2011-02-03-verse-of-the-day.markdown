_Ephesians 6:16  
Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to
quench all the fiery darts of the wicked._

If you don't start your day by putting on the shield of FAITH, you
might get wounded! Wounded? How? Satan's fiery darts can attack you
in the form of fears, doubts, temptations, and discouragements. The
shield of FAITH is put in place through prayer, believing His Word,
and spiritual awareness. Don't be fooled Christian, you need God's
weapons to fight the enemy!! Are you ready for battle?
