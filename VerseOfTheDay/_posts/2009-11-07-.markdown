title: November 7th - Extreme Love...Is Kind
---

_Matthew 5:11-12  
Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and
shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven:
for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you._

No one really enjoys being "rained" on by others. So how do you get
to the point that where you can rejoice when someone "dumps" on you?
If you could remember that most of these conflicts are spiritual at
the root, you will be more apt to respond with kindness. Christians
throughout the ages have been engaged in spiritual warfare, and the
Bible tells us that these battles were won through prayer, love, with
the focus on JESUS. Be encouraged to treat others better than they
deserve, for great is your reward in heaven!
