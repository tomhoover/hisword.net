_II Timothy 2:15  
Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not
to be ashamed._

With God as your partner in life, there are some responsibilities
that He has given you to carry out. In order to find out what's
required of you, you must study His Word. This may be the day when
someone asks you why Christians always have hope. Don&rsquo;t be
ashamed, have your answer ready!
