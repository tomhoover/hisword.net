_Psalm 103:2  
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits._

There are lots of earthly benefits to being a Christian. As you are
cleaning up your house today, go over the blessings and benefits of
being a child of God. Praising God should make your work easier and
put a smile on your face!
