_I Corinthians 13:5a  
Doth not behave itself unseemly..._

You've been there and can remember that feeling. You weren't
expecting to be treated rudely, but out of nowhere you were slapped
in the face with harsh words from someone. You can choose to take
offense and retaliate, or you can model Jesus' example and keep your
emotions in check. Jesus could read minds and He understood things,
that we, as mere mortals, cannot . The lesson we learn from Jesus is
to let Him be the judge of others, and our part is to pray for His
help to love and treat people better than they deserve! That's
EXTREME LOVE at its best!
