_I Chronicles 16:27  
Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in
his place._

You have been invited to God's place today. God is with you and
wants to share His life with you. He has given you strength and
gladness to make your day better. Spend some time visiting with God.
He's got a big table with lots and lots of spiritual food!
