_Ephesians 6:24  
Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.
Amen._

There is grace for all men who continue constant in their undying
love of our Lord Jesus Christ. What a great promise! The challenge
for every believer is to daily check your love for the Lord, and make
sure that it is constant and strong. Love and grace can't flow from
your life, if you aren't attached to the source of love, Jesus
Christ! Precious Lord, please fill each of us with YOUR love and
grace today.
