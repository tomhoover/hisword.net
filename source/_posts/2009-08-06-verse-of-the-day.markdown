_Philippians 3:21  
Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto
his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even
to subdue all things unto himself._

You may be satisfied with your life, but God isn&rsquo;t! He uses
the trials of life to change you to become more like Him. The changes
God wants to make are on the inside of you. Are you changing? Your
Partner can help you!
