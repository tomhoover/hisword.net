title: November 20th - Partnership with God in Prayer
---

_James 5:16b  
The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much._

Everyone wants God to hear their prayers and grant their petitions.
There are certain prayers, however, that really get God's attention.
These are the prayers that come from the heart of a genuine Christian
who lives a life according to His Word. C. H. Spurgeon said it this
way: "If you want that splendid power in prayer, you must remain in
loving, living, lasting, conscious, practical, abiding union with the
Lord Jesus Christ." That sounds like a partnership!
