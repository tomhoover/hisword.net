_Exodus 14:14  
The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace._

"Holding your peace" has got to be one of the hardest things in the
world! There is this independent part of you that wants to handle
things your way; but God reminds you once again that when He fights
the battles, victory is certain. It takes FAITH to trust God, and
keep your mouth shut! Take the challenge and do just that today!
