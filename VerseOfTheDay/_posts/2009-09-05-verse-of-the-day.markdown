_I Corinthians 12:20  
And now are they many members, yet but one body._

There are people who are out-going and there are people who are
reserved. There are people who are organized and there are people who
can pull things together at the last minute. There are people who are
thin, and there are people who are fluffy. There are people who are
plain white, and there are people who come in full living color. But
they are all ONE, alike, in God's church, when they work together.
You are accepted, so be part of the One!
