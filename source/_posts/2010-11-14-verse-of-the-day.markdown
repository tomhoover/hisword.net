_Exodus 35:2a  
Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be
to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD..._

Many Christians debate this issue of "resting" on Sunday. What does
"resting" mean in our busy world? This admonition is part of the ten
commandments, given by God, Who understands what is good and
profitable for His children. The whole idea behind "rest" is that you
make this day different from the six days before it. The things you do
on Monday-Saturday often place you on the world's calendar of events.
When you see Sunday on the calendar, it means this is God's DAY of
events, not yours. "Resting" is taking a break from the world's
demands, and giving God your full attention.
