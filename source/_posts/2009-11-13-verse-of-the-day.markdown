_Psalm 88:11  
Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy
faithfulness in destruction?_

What can a dead person do? In other words, you better get busy and
show love and kindness while you can. The life God has given you, has
a time limit on it. Forget your past expressions of love and kindness.
How will you show love and kindness today ?
