_John 3:16  
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting
life._

This is still one of the most powerful verses in the entire Bible!
When you share this verse with someone who doesn't know about God's
love, your Partner promises to accompany His Word and "touch" their
heart. It all begins with your attitude of caring so much about
others, that you will "sow" the seed, and let God do His part.
