title: April 15th - Partnership with God for a Victorious Life
---

_Psalm 18:19  
He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,
because he delighted in me._

God delights in providing for His children. In fact He wants to
give you more than you can imagine, like He did for David in our
verse. If you have a need in your life today, stop and solicit your
Partner's help. God loves you very much, and is tenderly listening
for your voice to reach His throne.
