_John 17:15  
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that
thou shouldest keep them from the evil._

It would be a lot easier to think the right things if we didn't
have the evil words of the world being thrown up to us all the time.
Jesus prayed for believers to "elevate their thinking" as they live
in the midst of this evil world. This means you can't be passive. You
are to go against this present culture. In other words, you must
prepare your heart every day if you are to have the proper response
for a watching world.
