_Matthew 16:26  
For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and
lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his
soul?_

This time of year we often read or see Charles Dickens' work, A
Christmas Carol. The character of Scrooge, in that story, reminds us
that there are more important things in life than making money. Be
reminded as you go throughout your day that the souls of the people
in your life, are of greatest priority!
