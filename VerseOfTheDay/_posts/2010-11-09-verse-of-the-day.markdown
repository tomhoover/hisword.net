_Psalm 68:6  
God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which
are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land._

There may be family members in your life that you would just love
to change. God reminds us that He deals with the rebellious, in His
time and in His way. FAITH is trusting God for the things that only
He can change. Keep your FAITH in God fueled with prayer. Never stop
praying! God is still breaking the chains that bind stubborn
hearts!
