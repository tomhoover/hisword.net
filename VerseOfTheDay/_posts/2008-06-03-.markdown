title: June 3rd - God&rsquo;s Place of Peace
---

_John 14:27  
Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world
giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let
it be afraid._

There is nothing better than starting your day off with peace. If
you are fearful about a situation in your life today, stop and pray
for God&rsquo;s peace to fill you. The world thinks peace is about
not having any troubles. God&rsquo;s peace doesn&rsquo;t always
remove trouble and fears, but it will enable you to face them and see
beyond them.
