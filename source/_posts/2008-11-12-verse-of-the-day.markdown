_Psalm 34:4  
I sought the Lord, and He heard me, and delivered me from all my
fears._

Under the canopy of prayer and God's presence, there is a sense of
security and hope unlike anything else in this world. If you find
yourself worrying or fearful over a situation in your life, be
reminded that the Creator of the world, is in partnership with you.
There is nothing that can reach you that did not first come by Him.
Smile!
