title: November 26th - Partnership with God in Prayer

_Colossians 4:2  
Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving._

A person who doesn't pray much is saying by his actions that he
doesn't have a very strong faith. If your faith is strong, you
continue in prayer, knowing it will be only a matter of time before
God intervenes on your behalf. Faith, makes it possible for you to
thank God in advance, for what you believe He is going to do.
