_I John 5:4-5  
For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the
victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that
overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of
God?_

Imagine this: God is using today's difficulties to strengthen you
for tomorrow! That may be good, but it may not always be fun! The
best consolation is the fact that He has promised to be PRESENT in
your tribulations, and to help you overcome. Your part is to BELIEVE!
When you believe, your FAITH is stretched beyond the limitations of
today! FAITH in Jesus Christ literally overcomes and LIFTS you above
life's difficulties!
