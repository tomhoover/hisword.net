_Psalm 5:8  
Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make
thy way straight before my face._

All Christians have enemies, you just can&rsquo;t see them. Whether
a believer is living in relative spiritual ease, under severe
persecution, his/her enemy is not "flesh and blood," but
"principalities," and "powers," the "rulers of the darkness of this
world," and "spiritual wickedness in high places." (Eph. 6:12). These
fallen angels/demons will do all they can to keep you from enjoying
the spiritually abundant life that Jesus wants for you (cf. Psalm
1:1-3; John 10:10).
