_Proverbs 17:3  
The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD
trieth the hearts._

Who likes trials and problems? There aren't too many people who
"thank" God for their trials! Trials are one of those things that we
want to be over ASAP!! The comfort we get from this verse is that
trials make you worth more in God's eyes, when they are over. Hang on
child of God, there is an expiration date, and you are precious to
GOD!
