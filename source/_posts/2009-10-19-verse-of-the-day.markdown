_II Timothy 2:3  
Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ._

Do you ever get tired of this life and all its burdens and cares?
This is not one of those days when you can give in to your feelings!
If you are going to endure, you must have the proper mind-set. Think
of yourself as a soldier. This means you must "fight" against
thoughts that would pull you down and, focus on Jesus in the battle
right beside you! YES, SIR, LORD!
