_Matthew 11:6  
And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me._

Need some happiness in your life? Let go of all the thoughts and
memories of those who have offended you in the past. When you choose
to remember how people have offended you, you are just asking for a
dark cloud to come over your life. Why not live in the happiness and
forgiveness of God's grace?
