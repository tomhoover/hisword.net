_Psalm 26:3  
For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy
truth._

Some people call it infatuation. You might call it "falling deeply
in love." Others might call it EXTREME LOVE. After you ask Jesus into
your heart, your life changes. Your focus now is on your LORD, who is
truth, and you will want to become like Him. Jesus loved everyone,
whether they deserved it or not! Walk with the TRUTH and love your
world today!
