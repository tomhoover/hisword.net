title: September 22nd - Partnership with God in the Church

_Ephesians 5:29  
For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and
cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church._

If you knew you could do something that would improve your life,
you would probably do it. If you needed to lose weight to save your
life, you would get busy. The Lord Jesus Christ had this same mind
set about His church. He left instruction in His Word regarding the
work of true churches. Jesus loves His churches and wants "love" to
be at their center! More "love" would improve your life and that of
every church on this earth. Get busy!
