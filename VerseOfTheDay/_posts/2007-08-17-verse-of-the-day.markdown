_Deuteronomy 29:9  
Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may
prosper in all that ye do._

This is the message from Psalm 1: The believer who mediates on, and
keeps God's Word, is "like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that
bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not
wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper." There is no richer,
more prosperous person on earth than a Christian who has learned to
lose His life for Christ that he might find it.
