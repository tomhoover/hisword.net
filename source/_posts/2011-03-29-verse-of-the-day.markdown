_Psalm 31:23  
O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the
faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer._

Do you plan to get in your car today and drive somewhere? Do you
need some added protection? Our verse reminds us that the Lord
preserves those who are FAITH-FULL to Him! This should motivate you
to live your life today, and every day, to please the Lord, not just
for His rewards, but because you FAITH FULLY love Him!
