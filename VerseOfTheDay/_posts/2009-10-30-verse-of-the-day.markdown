title: October 30th - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_James 5:10  
Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the
Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience._

There is a Chinese proverb that says, "One moment of patience may
ward off disaster. One moment of impatience may ruin a whole life."
If you are to let patience have its perfect work in your life, you
must be willing to make the proper decision and suffer affliction if
necessary. The Christians who have gone before you, would say the
suffering upon this earth is nothing compared to the glories that
await you!
