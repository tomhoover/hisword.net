title: September 5th - Extreme Love...endures through trials.

_II Corinthians 1:4  
Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to
comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we
ourselves are comforted of God._

If you are a Christian, God has a "growth plan" for your life. You
may not want to grow stronger, but this is God's plan for every
believer. He can use the "good" and "bad" experiences in your life to
teach and comfort you and other Christians. As you go through your
day, look for an opportunity to share your testimony with someone
regarding a time when God comforted you. It will make your day even
sweeter!
