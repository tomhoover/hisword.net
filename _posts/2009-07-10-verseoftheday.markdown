_I Peter 4:16  
Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but
let him glorify God on this behalf._

Most of us suffer very little for the cause of Christ in America.
One of the greatest things you can do for Christ, is to freely speak
about Him in all your conversations, no matter with whom you are
talking today. Don't be ashamed of Christ. Boldly proclaim His place
in your life. You may not always have this freedom in America!
