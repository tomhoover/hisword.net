title: March 22nd - Extreme Love...is giving.
---

_II Corinthians 10:18  
For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord
commendeth._

That's pretty much the way God works. He doesn't always love like
we would. He has compassion and tenderness for the world's outcasts.
He sees the one who has lost his way, and goes after that one. He
takes time for all those little things, and includes children and
prayer in His life. He applauds the widow who gives her last coin. He
exalts the humble in spirit, and has harsh words for the proud of
heart. Will the Lord commend your actions today?
