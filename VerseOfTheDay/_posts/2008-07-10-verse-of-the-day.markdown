_II Corinthians 6:2  
For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day
of salvation have I succourred you, behold, now is the accepted time,
the day of salvation._

Today&rsquo;s the day! Is there something in your life that you
have been putting off doing? If you haven&rsquo;t asked Jesus into
your heart, today&rsquo;s the day. If you have a needy friend,
today&rsquo;s the day. If you need to re-commit your heart to God,
today&rsquo;s the day. You are only promised today, not tomorrow!
