_Philippians 4:6  
Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto
God._

Have you ever heard of &ldquo;breath prayers&rdquo;? God is as
close as your breath; you can spend your entire day with Him&ndash;
even on the run. The secret is a short prayer that you whisper to God
,as experiences prompt you throughout the day. This will bring a
greater awareness of God&rsquo;s presence in your life, as well as
keep you praying for everything in your life. Take the challenge!
