_I John 1:5-7  
5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare
unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.  
6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness,
we lie, and do not the truth:  
7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
cleanseth us from all sin._

To Him who is both Light and the Creator of light, there cannot
possibly be any darkness at all, for if there was, He would cease to
be Light! In Him is no ignorance, no imperfection, no sinfulness, no
darkness at all; and from Him the light of wisdom, knowledge,
holiness, happiness, and life, temporal and eternal, are received by
every believing soul.
