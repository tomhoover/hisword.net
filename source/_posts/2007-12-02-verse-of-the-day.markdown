_Genesis 22:8  
And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a
burnt offering: so they went both of them together._

God, the Father, provided His Son, Jesus, to be a sacrificial Lamb
for you. He gave His best, and you are asked to give your sins to
Him. This is an awesome "gift exchange!"
