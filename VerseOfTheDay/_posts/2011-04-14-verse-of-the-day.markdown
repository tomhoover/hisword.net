_Revelation 7:12  
Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and
honor, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever.
Amen._

Christian, when was the last time you praised God out loud for his
involvement in your life? The setting for our verse is futuristic,
but there's no reason that you couldn't, and shouldn't, praise God
right now! According to the Scriptures, God longs for the praise and
adoration of His creation. Praise God for His wisdom, honor, power
and might! You are blessed, Christian! Voice His praise all the day
long!
