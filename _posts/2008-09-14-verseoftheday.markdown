title: September 14th - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Micah 7:18-19  
18 Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth
by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not
his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.  
19 He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will
subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the
depths of the sea._

Have you ever dropped some money in a lake or the ocean and tried
to find it? It is almost impossible, as the water moving over the
sand quickly covers it up. God has done this same thing with your
confessed sins! Those sins of the past, that bother you, God has
already forgotten. You must forgive yourself, because God has already
washed it away!
