_Hebrews 11:6  
But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh
to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
diligently seek him._

Where would you be without FAITH? The world, the economy, the
government, the family, are all built around faith in people,
covenants, and agreements. Faith is an integral part of everyone's
life. God demonstrates faith in your world, so you can understand
what He most desires of you. He wants you to believe that He is who
He says He is and will do what He says He will. So then, why do you
NOT have the FAITH to believe that He will lovingly provide for your
every need? TRUST GOD and enjoy life!
