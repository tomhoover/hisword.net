_Psalm 121:7-8  
7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy
soul.  
8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this
time forth, and even for evermore._

God not only keeps His own in all evil times, but from all evil
influences and operations, yea, from evils themselves. The Lord
keeps/preserves us against the evil and supernatural power of the
"god of the world" who would like nothing better than to be able to
separate us from the love of Christ, which praise God, Paul tells us
in Romans 8 is impossible.
