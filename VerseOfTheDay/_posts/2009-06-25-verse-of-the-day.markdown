title: June 25th - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith
---

_Psalm 16:7  
I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: my reins also
instruct me in the night seasons._

Why does FAITH grow weaker in the midst of the darkness of night?
If you have shut out God's counsel, the Light and power source,
darkness will penetrate and erode your FAITH. On the other hand, if
you take God's Word with you at night and keep it upon your mind, it
will force darkness to flee. This is called the "night LIGHT of
FAITH!"
