_I John 4:9  
In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God
sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through
him._

What is the Christmas season without the love of God? The world
wants to remove the word "Christmas" from the season. When they
remove Christ, darkness fills the vacuum. Use the name of Christ
while you can!
