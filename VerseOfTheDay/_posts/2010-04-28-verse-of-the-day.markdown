title: April 28th - Extreme Love...works at overcoming anger.
---

_Matthew 5:22a  
But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without
a cause shall be in danger of the judgment._

When you are upset, you might think anger is the way to resolve a
problem with a brother. In truth, anger, when unleashed, really
becomes a thief. It steals the peace, joy, and happiness in your
life. Anger is like holding on to a hot coal and thinking you can
throw it at someone else, but instead you are the one who gets
burned. You never win when you get angry, all you get are tense
muscles! Release your load and enjoy life!
