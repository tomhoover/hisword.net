_Ephesians 2:10  
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,
which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them._

What are those good works? Praying, witnessing, visiting,
care-giving, serving, encouraging, sympathizing with, singing,
teaching, helping, listening, and comforting are just a few of things
that the Holy Spirit might lead you to do for a needy heart today. God
has given you some special gifts and skills to be used to bring Him
glory. Purpose to be a "good worker" and do your best!
