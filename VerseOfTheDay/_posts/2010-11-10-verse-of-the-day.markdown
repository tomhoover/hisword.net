_I Peter 2:1-3  
Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
and envies, and all evil speakings. As newborn babes, desire the
sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby; If so be ye have
tasted that the Lord is gracious._

Babies are made with a built-in desire for milk! They don't know
all the benefits of drinking milk, in place of Coca-cola, but their
parents do! Our heavenly Father knows what you need to make you grow,
even if you don't. Through His Word, God wants to grow up His children
and teach them the proper way to speak and act. God knows that when
you speak FAITH, not fear and doubt, your FAITH will grow! Christian,
grow up!! SPEAK FAITH today! A watching world is listening to you!
