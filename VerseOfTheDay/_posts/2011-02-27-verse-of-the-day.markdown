title: February 27th - FaithForce...engaging your faith in Spiritual
---

_Psalm 91:11  
For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all
thy ways._

Have you ever been rescued from a perilous situation and knew it
was God, and God alone, who preserved your life? Sometimes we can be
slow to give God the credit, but the Christian can see God's
handprint in their life! These moments are just another blessing that
FAITH brings into your life. Verse 14 qualifies this blessing as being
given to someone who " has set his love upon God," or who has clinging
FAITH. Christian, take a moment and thank God for His provision of
care for you!
