_Psalm 86:15  
But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth._

Mondays can be "extreme," if you haven't had time with the Lord.
What a comfort it is to know that God can give you what you need to
not only survive the day, but to be better for the day. God doesn't
have just a "little" compassion, grace, patience and mercy. He has an
"extreme" amount to give to all who need it on Monday or any other
day.
