title: March 20th - God&rsquo;s Place of Promise
---

_I Corinthians 11:26  
For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew
the Lord's death till he come._

As Easter is approaching, spend some time today thinking about the
scenes before, during and after the cross. Did you remember His
compassion? His endurance? His sacrifice? His fulfilled promises?
Thank you Jesus!
