_Galatians 6:9-10  
9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall
reap, if we faint not.  
10 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,
especially unto them who are of the household of faith._

The thought of being "weary" here is actually to be weak or to fail
by giving in to evil or giving up because of evil. To "faint" is
literally to relax our efforts to serve because of the evil that
opposes us. We serve, not because of the expected or hoped for
results, but because the Lord we love has commanded us to be His
servant and to do His work. The results belong to the Lord, so be not
weary and do not faint in doing good to all, especially to our family
members in Christ.
