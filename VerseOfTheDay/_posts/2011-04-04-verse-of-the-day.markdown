_Psalm 62:11  
God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth
unto God._

Do you believe that all POWER belongs to God? God only has to speak
it once! The problem seems to be on our end. We hear it, but we don't
believe it! Jesus repeatedly told the multitudes that those who have
ears, need to listen and believe!
Hear the right voice today: "ALL Power belongs to GOD! Put your
FAITH in HIM!"
