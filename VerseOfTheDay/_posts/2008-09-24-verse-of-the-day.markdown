_Acts 13:38  
Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this
man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins._

Jesus Christ died on the cross for you, that your sins might be
forgiven. Paul preached this message in Antioch, because he had a
deep understanding of the change this truth could make in a life.
Will you care enough about someone to share that same truth today?
