_Romans 8:38-39  
38 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,  
39 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
Lord._

"It's still snowing," said Eeyore gloomily. "So it is." "And
freezing." "Is it?" "Yes," said Eeyore. "However," he said,
brightening up a little, "we haven't had an earthquake lately."
&ndash;from Winnie the Pooh
You may have had some problems in your life lately, but cheer up,
one thing in your life never changes, "God still loves you!" Smile!
