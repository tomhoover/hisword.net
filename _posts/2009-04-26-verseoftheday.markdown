_Psalm 27:13  
I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord
in the land of the living._

There can be days that, if you didn't know God was watching and
caring for you, you might be tempted to give up . That's why this
verse is in the Bible. When you are at your lowest and feel like you
are going under, remind yourself of this promise: God's grace and
goodness will always abound until He takes you home. Find His
goodness (it&rsquo;s there) and praise it!
