_II Thessalonians 3:3  
But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from
evil._

Even if you don't have faith, God is faithful to you. He will take
care of you, and keep you from evil, if you will submit to Him. Do
you ever wonder why certain doors in your life are closed? Could God
be keeping you from evil and its harmful influence in your life? God
has promised to keep evil on a leash. He promises to give you a way
out of every evil circumstance in your life. God is faithful. Are you
faithful to commit your way to Him?
