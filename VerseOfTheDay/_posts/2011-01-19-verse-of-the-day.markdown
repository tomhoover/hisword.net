_Joshua 4:24  
That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD,
that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever._

Has something ever happened in your life that you knew was beyond
you, and it had to be God? Actually there is more than an occasional
manifestation of God in your life. Every day God is powerfully
involved bringing victory in impossible situations for His sake,
whether you recognize His hand or not. Wake up Christian! You serve a
MAGNIFICENT GOD! He's listening for your praise and acknowledgment!
