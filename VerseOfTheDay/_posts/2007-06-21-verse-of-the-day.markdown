_Romans 5:5  
And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad
in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us._

The Greek word for "shed abroad" means to gush or to pour out in
abundance. Think about this verse. This epitomizes what the believer
in Christ has at all times, that the unbeliever cannot have, but
should crave. We have the presence of the Holy Spirit, God Himself,
filling us with the knowledge and power of the love of God. This
truth makes all the difference!
