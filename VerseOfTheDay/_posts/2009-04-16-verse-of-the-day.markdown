title: April 16th - Partnership with God for a Victorious Life
---

_James 1:14-16  
14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust,
and enticed.  
15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin,
when it is finished, bringeth forth death.  
16 Do not err, my beloved brethren._

Napoleon Bonaparte said, /"The most dangerous moment comes when
there is victory."/ Just because you had victory over sin yesterday,
doesn't mean that you will automatically have victory today. It is
dangerous not to take sin seriously, and deal with it promptly. Ask
God to give you victory over sin in your life today!
