title: April 23rd- God&rsquo;s Place of Care
---

_Psalm 142:4-5  
4 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that
would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.  
5 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my
portion in the land of the living._

There are days when we feel like no one notices us, or even cares
about us. Be assured that your value and worth cannot be measured in
man&rsquo;s emotional applause. God&rsquo;s care for you is not based
on performance, but upon His unconditional LOVE.
