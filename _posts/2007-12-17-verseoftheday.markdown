title: December 17th - God's Place of Provision
---

_Romans 14:17  
For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost._

Don&rsquo;t focus on the food and parties. Christmas is about being
right with God, at peace with others, and a joyful spirit. Touch a
life with God&rsquo;s joy!
