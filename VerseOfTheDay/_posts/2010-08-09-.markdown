title: August 9th - Extreme Love...hopes and believes the best.
---

_Lamentations 3:22-23  
It is of the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his
compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy
faithfulness._

The Lord God of heaven and earth is faithful every morning to give
you a fresh supply of mercy. For the Christian, this means you are
blessed on a daily basis, whether you are deserving or not. Now, that
is EXTREME LOVE on God's part! Since God is so good to you, don't you
think you could also be merciful to that person, in your life, who
doesn't deserve mercy? God's compassion never stops!
