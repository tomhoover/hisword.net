title: February 16th - FaithForce...engaging your faith in Spiritual
---

_I Corinthians 9:27  
But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by
any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a
castaway._

As a Christian, have you ever said, "I will never do that!"? The
verse today reminds us that unless you purpose and work to keep your
heart and life, you could become a castaway. In other words, if you
don't feed your FAITH, your love for God can fall away. You can lose
your fellowship, but not your salvation. Before you go any further,
spend some time with your Savior. It's the best thing you will do
today!
