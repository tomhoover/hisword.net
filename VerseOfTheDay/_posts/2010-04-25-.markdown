title: April 25th - Extreme Love...works at overcoming anger.
---

_I Thessalonians 5:9  
For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by
our Lord Jesus Christ._

If you have given your heart through repentance and faith to the
Lord Jesus Christ, you will not face the wrath of God when you leave
this earth one day. You are so blessed! You must stop and thank God
for the assurance that you will never face His anger; but what about
the people around you? Tell someone about the saving faith of Jesus
today, while you can! Share your blessings!
