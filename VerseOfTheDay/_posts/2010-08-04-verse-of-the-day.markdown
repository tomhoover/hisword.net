title: August 4th - Extreme Love...hopes and believes the best.
---

_Luke 21:28  
And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift
up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh._

LOOK UP! It's a bird, it's a plane, no, it's called, HOPE! Don't
let the cares and struggles of this world, pull you down and
discourage you. Instead, look up! Look unto God, who alone can redeem
a soul and guarantee eternal life! If you have placed your HOPE in
Jesus Christ, you can be lifted up when you dwell upon His love and
blessings in your life! LOOK UP, Christian, the best is not far
off!
