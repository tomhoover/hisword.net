title: March 28th - God&rsquo;s Place of Promise
---

_James 1:12  
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried,
he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to
them that love him._

The crown of life is promised to those who say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to
temptation, because of their great love for the Lord. Ask God to help
you make good choices today! God&rsquo;s crowns aren&rsquo;t made to
fit those who have the big head.
