title: September 21st - Extreme Love...endures through trials.
---

_II Corinthians 4:8-10  
We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed,
but not in despair; Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not
destroyed; Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord
Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our
body._

It's amazing just to contemplate the ways of God. They are beyond
our human comprehension. Problems and trials in your life are just
part of God's ways. Whether you pass the test of your trial or not,
God can use it in the life of others. Therefore, the first part of
our verse encourages you to have the right attitude concerning your
trials. It assures you that God is with you in every minute and
detail, therefore you can have victory through the Lord Jesus!! You
are not forsaken!! Celebrate that promise today!
