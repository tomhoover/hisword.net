_Isaiah 53:5  
But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his
stripes we are healed._

Passover begins at Sunset today. If you were Jewish and lived in
Bible times, you would celebrate God's magnificent deliverance for
the next seven days! In our too busy, self-absorbed world, thinking
about God for seven days in a row might seem a bit much! Would you
take the challenge and purpose to think about what Jesus Christ did
for YOU personally during the next seven days? Would you thank Him
for the peace that comes through FAITH in Him? If you will, God
through FAITH will LIFT you above your earthly struggles!
