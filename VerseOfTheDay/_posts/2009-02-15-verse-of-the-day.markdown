_Ephesians 4:32  
And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you._

In the work place, and our day to day lives, we have all made
mistakes. There will probably be someone you will come in contact
with today who will need your forgiveness. It may be a traffic
altercation, a harsh word, or a false judgment concerning you. No
matter what, remember that God for Christ's sake has forgiven you,
and you need to do the same.
