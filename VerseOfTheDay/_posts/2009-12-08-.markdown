title: December 8th - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_Psalm 16:11  
Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of
joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore._

Are you searching for just the right gift for one of your friends?
Christmas is found in the heart of a believer, not under a tree. Joy
is found in Jesus, not a gift inside a box. Happiness is found in
God's eternal love, not in the pleasures of this world. Lasting peace
is found in a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, not in
possessions. Why not give the gift that lasts for a lifetime?
