_Malachi 3:8  
Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have
we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings._

Before it gets any closer to Christmas, take a moment and consider
what you are going to give to God this year. Will you give your
tithe? Will you give an offering? Don't rob God, He deserves
better.
