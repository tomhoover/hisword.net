_Colossians 3:12  
Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering._

If you are a Christian, you are called to live a holy life which
reflects God's attributes. God's mercy and compassion are
demonstrated when He prompts you to do kind deeds of love for others,
whether they are worthy of it or not. Can you think of someone you
could bless today with a "random act of kindness?" God will give you
a face, if you'll ask Him.
