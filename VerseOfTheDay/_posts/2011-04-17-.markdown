_Ephesians 3:16  
That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be
strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man._

PRAYER is the answer for a dull life! Prayer is, without doubt, the
most anemic part of most every Christian's life. To think that we have
access to the ear of God, Himself, and yet we are too busy to talk
with Him! Someday, when we get to heaven, it will be one of our
greatest regrets, as we are shown the difference our prayers could
have made! It's great to prepare your outward appearance every day,
but have you asked God to prepare your inner man? LIFT your heart up
to God, and ask Him to strengthen your inner man.
