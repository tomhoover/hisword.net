_James 1:12  
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried,
he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to
them that love him._

This is just one of the "crowns" that is promised to the FAITH FULL
believer. It's called the crown of life, and the Lord will bestow it
upon those who have been tested and have overcome, in the area of
temptation. Every day believers are tempted! Have you been tempted to
lie? Have you been tempted sexually? Have you been tempted to "give
up" serving God? Did you overcome and persevere? Be encouraged
Christian, God has a crown for you!
