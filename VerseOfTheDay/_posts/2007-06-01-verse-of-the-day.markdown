_II Peter 1:19  
We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well
that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place,
until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts._

Jesus Christ is the "DAY STAR." "I am the root and the offspring of
David, and the bright and morning star." (Rev. 22:16) The reality of
Christ's arising in the heart by His Spirit, giving full assurance,
creates a spiritual fullness in the heart. This is associated with
the coming of the Day of the Lord, as being the earnest or assurance
of it, although our hearts shall not fully realize Christ in all the
unspeakable glory of His body presence, until He shall come.
