_Deuteronomy 8:11  
Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his
commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command
thee this day._

Are things not working out in your life like you expected? The key
to victory is most often found in obedience. Some of life&rsquo;s
greatest victories and blessings are a direct result of obeying
God&rsquo;s commandments.
