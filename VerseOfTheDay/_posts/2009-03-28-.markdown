title: March 28th - Partnership with God to Touch Lives
---

_II Corinthians 4:7  
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of
the power may be of God, and not of us._

Your life is represented in this verse as a treasure. God has
placed some priceless jewels in your life, of which salvation in
Jesus Christ is the primary one. Since you only have one life to
live, and it is so short, you should make every day count for the
Lord. Ask God to use your life for His honor and glory today!
