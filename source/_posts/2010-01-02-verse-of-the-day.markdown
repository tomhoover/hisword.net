_II Timothy 3:1-4  
This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For
men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without
natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent,
fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady,
highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God._

This could easily be the year when the Lord returns! We are given a
description of what people will be like in the last days prior to the
Lord's return. It's interesting that this description begins and ends
with a reference to mankind's love. They will be "lovers of self, and
lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God." You could make a huge
difference in your world, if you would purpose to put God and others
before yourself.
God's extreme love shines brightest in these dark days!
