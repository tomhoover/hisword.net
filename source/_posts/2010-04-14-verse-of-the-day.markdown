_Psalm 103:8  
The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in
mercy._

There is still a large supply of "grace and mercy" available. Isn't
that encouraging? God's resources are not limited, but instead,
endless. You must ask for your own download, though. Yesterday's were
not enough! May you be "merciful and gracious" to all those who come
into your life today, as you download HIS resources through prayer.
