title: June 19th - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith
---

_Psalm 4:8  
I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep; for Thou, Lord, only
makest me dwell in safety._

In a world that is increasingly more violent every day, you could
have trouble sleeping, if you were fearful. God tells you to put your
FAITH in Him, picturing Him right beside you, as your very own
personal security guard. Feed your FAITH and starve your fear! You
are at peace with God and all mankind when you hear the silence and
do not feel alone.
