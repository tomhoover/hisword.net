_Psalm 91:15  
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in
trouble; I will deliver him, and honor him._

Did you read that verse? WOW! What a deal! If you will CALL upon
the LORD in the midst of trouble, He will be with you! He also says
He will deliver you. Now, your thoughts of deliverance may not be the
same as God's, but the outstanding thought is, you are NOT ALONE!
God's EXTREME LOVE, when called upon, DELIVERS Him! Be encouraged,
Christian, He's as close as the mention of His name.
