_II Corinthians 1:20  
For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto
the glory of God by us._

You can put your trust in the promises of God. Unlike you, God has
kept every promise He has ever made to mankind. If He said He will be
with you, then you can take it to the bank! David Nicholas said,
"God's promises are like the stars. The darker the night, the
brighter they shine." An unknown author said, " I believe in the sun
even when it isn't shining, I believe in love even when I'm alone, I
believe in God, even when He is silent.&rdquo; Do you?
