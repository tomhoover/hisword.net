_Psalm 106:44-45  
44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their
cry:  
45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to
the multitude of his mercies._

Thank God that He hears and comforts your heart, even when you
don't deserve His mercy in your life. You need to share this with
someone and invite them to church tomorrow!
