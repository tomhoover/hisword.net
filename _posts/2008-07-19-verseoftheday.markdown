title: July 19th - God&rsquo;s Place of Salvation
---

_Mark 2:17  
When Jesus heard it, He saith unto them, They that are whole have no
need of a physician, but they that are sick; I came not to call the
righteous, but sinners to repentance._

Do you know anyone who has been &ldquo;sick&rdquo; lately? Do you
know anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know Jesus as their Savior? They need a
physician! Tell them about Jesus Christ, the Great Physician, who can
heal their heart. Don&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s too late.
