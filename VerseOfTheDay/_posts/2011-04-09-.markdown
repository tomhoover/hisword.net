_II Corinthians 13:4  
For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the
power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him
by the power of God toward you._

We don't understand this, but Jesus was 100% human flesh, and 100%
GOD, both at the same time! That's what makes this verse so amazing!
He didn't HAVE TO put up with the words of others, the physical
infirmities, and the pain of the sins of the world, but He did! He
submitted to human suffering, so that we might see how the POWER of
God can strengthen us. It is through submission that the POWER of God
is released, otherwise you are a weak solo act! GIVE YOUR PROBLEMS A
FAITH-LIFT! GOD IS FAITH FULL!
