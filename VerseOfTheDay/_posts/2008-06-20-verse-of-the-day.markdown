_Colossians 1:19-20  
19 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;  
20 And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to
reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be
things in earth, or things in heaven._

Do you need something to celebrate today? Celebrate the fact that
Jesus Christ has made peace for mankind through the blood of His
cross! When was the last time you just sat around the table and
voiced all your blessings? It&rsquo;s also a good excuse to bake a
chocolate cake and celebrate with a neighbor.
