_John 1:5  
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it
not._

They just don't know! There are so many in our world living without
hope or purpose in their lives! While you can't make blind people see
the LIGHT, God can. He is still in the business of opening the eyes

your life who refuse to see the LIGHT of the world! Pray BELIEVING!
