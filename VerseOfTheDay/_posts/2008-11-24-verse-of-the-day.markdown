title: November 24th - Partnership with God in Prayer
---

_John 15:7  
If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye
will, and it shall be done unto you._

At different times in our lives, we can find it hard to pray. It
can seem like there is a barrier between our prayers and our heavenly
Father. When this happens we must ask what it is that is separating us
from God. It can be sin, selfishness, or simple apathy. Abiding in
Jesus Christ means reconnecting to the vine, finding God in His Word,
and pouring our heart out to Him. If heaven seems far off, keep
praying! Your Partner is waiting to connect with you!
