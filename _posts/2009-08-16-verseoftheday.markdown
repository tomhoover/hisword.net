title: August 16th - Partnership with God for a Changed Life
---

_Romans 12:2  
And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and
acceptable, and perfect will of God._

It's so important for you to renew your mind every morning, because
the world will try to pull you away from God. How wonderful it is to
know that by calling upon God, there is help to change your thought
patterns. When you include God, "You can do all things with His
strength!" Be changed!
