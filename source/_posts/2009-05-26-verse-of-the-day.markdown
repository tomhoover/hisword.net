_Psalm 42:11  
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted
within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him, who is the
health of my countenance, and my God._

Someone said, /"You cannot direct the wind, but you can adjust your
sails!"/ When you feel like you're being pulled down by the winds of
discouragement, adjust your attitude. Find the good and praise the
Lord! It's like medicine for your soul!
