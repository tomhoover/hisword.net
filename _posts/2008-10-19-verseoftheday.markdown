title: October 19th - The Basics of Partnership
---

_I Corinthians 12:6  
And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God
which worketh all in all._

God has given you some special unique talents and traits that He
wants to blend with His perfection, to impact the world around you.
In fact, God has a plan for you to use one or more of those gifts
every day of your life. Isn't it exciting to think that God could use
you today? Expect great things from God today!
