title: January 10th - Partnership with God in Daily Disciplines
---

_Psalm 141:3  
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips._

In the course of this day, you will be challenged to give a proper
response to an improper attitude. If you have disciplined your mind
to please God, and have asked for His help, it could keep you from
saying the wrong thing. Be reminded that your words are powerful, so
choose them carefully.
