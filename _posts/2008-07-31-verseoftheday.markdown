title: July 31st - God&rsquo;s Place of Salvation
---

_I Timothy 2:3-4  
2 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;  
3 Who will have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of
truth._

This is the last day of July, hopefully it won&rsquo;t be the last
day for you or someone you know to give their heart to Jesus Christ.
The most important decision in life is the salvation of your soul.
The Bible clearly states that there is only ONE way of salvation, and
that is through confessing your sin and putting your faith and trust
in Jesus Christ. Don&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s too late!
