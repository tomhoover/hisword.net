_Psalm 119:81  
My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word._

There are those days when you could just crumble or melt in defeat
were it not for the promises in the WORD of God! Have you thanked God
for His foresight to provide the encouragement of His written WORD for
those difficult days? The child of God should never despair, because
God has given you promises in His WORD that are more secure and real
than anything within your touch. FAITH-BOOK. Get it out and read it!
God wrote it for YOUR needs today!
