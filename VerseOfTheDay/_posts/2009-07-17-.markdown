_I Peter 3:15  
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to
give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that
is in you with meekness and fear._

We've all had those moments in time when we wanted to witness for
the Lord, but we just couldn't seem to say the right thing. The best
way to overcome this is to rehearse, in your mind, a way to express
your faith in God. Then ask God to show you how to express His
wonderful hope. Be ready! Today is the day!
