_John 6:68  
Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast
the words of eternal life._

Are you needing security about your future life?
Simon Peter got it right in our verse! There is no one who has
conquered death, but Jesus Christ. That qualifies Him, sets Him apart
from all the other leaders of false religions, as the only One who can
give eternal life! FAITH secures your future.
Are you needing security in your present life?
Jesus not only offers life insurance, He provides disability
insurance through FAITH in Him. He promises to supply and care for
His children when we live by FAITH.
What else do you need?
