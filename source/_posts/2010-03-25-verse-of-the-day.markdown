_Matthew 5:42  
Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee
turn not thou away._

What do you have that hasn't come from God? We want to claim
ownership of what we possess, but actually everything we have came
from God, and still belongs to Him. With that thought in mind, how
can we hoard God's stuff and not freely share it with others? May you
be encouraged to take your hands off the possessions that God has put
in your care, and let God bless the needy through your life.
