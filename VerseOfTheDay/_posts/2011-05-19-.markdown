title: May 19th - FaithSearch...examining your Faith in the midst of life's
---

_Psalm 66:10  
For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is
tried._

Someone said, "If you knew someone was watching you, would you do
anything different today?" Well the truth is, God is watching you
today, and He's searching for FAITH. Will your life display FAITH or
FEAR? Be mindful today, that you represent the KING!
