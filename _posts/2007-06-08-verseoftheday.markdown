_Psalm 28:8  
The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his
anointed._

Walk with the Lord. Walk intimately with Him. Abide with Christ on
you life and He and the Father will both abide with you and manifest
Themselves amazingly in your spiritual life (see John 14:21-23). The
Father and the Son, abiding with us through the Holy Spirit is our
source of strength.
