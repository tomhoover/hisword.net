_Matthew 28:20  
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
Amen._

Jesus speaks to all of His churches through this portion of the
Great Commission to His first church in Jerusalem. This is why
compromise of Biblical truth is never an option. A church must
continue to be a lighthouse of truth in this world. Where there is no
lighthouse, God's people grope about in the darkness of ignorance and
confusion. Jesus has not only given us His teaching to proclaim and
uphold, He has promised to be with His churches as they do it.
