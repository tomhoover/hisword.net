_I Peter 5:6  
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He
may exalt you in due time._

How are your resolutions coming along? Are you staying on track?
The secret for the Christian is in realizing that you need God's help
if you are going to accomplish anything. This requires you to submit
to Him and His leadership, if you are going to have His best. You can
do it&ndash; with HIS HELP!
