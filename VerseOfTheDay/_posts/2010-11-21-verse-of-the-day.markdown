_Psalm 100:4  
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with
praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name._

Is it part of your character to "praise" God? Do you find yourself
"praising" or "complaining" more? Today is Sunday! Rather than
complaining about imperfect people in your life, you need to go to
church and "praise the Lord!" It's quite humbling that your Perfect
Savior loves YOU, and everyone else, just as they are, imperfect! May
FAITH shape your attitudes and expressions today!
