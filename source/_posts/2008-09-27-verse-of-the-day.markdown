_Colossians 1:14  
In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness
of sins._

You were redeemed to live a righteous life, not go back to your
sinful ways. After we've been saved for a while, we can forget the
daily need to confess our sins. Christians can redefine selfishness,
improper attitudes, and lack of love for others, and choose to forget
that God calls it sin. You may even have to confess your sins
throughout the day, to keep a right relationship with the Father.
