_II Chronicles 31:21  
And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God,
and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it
with all his heart, and prospered._

Going to church and keeping God's commandments are things that you
should "want to do," not "have to do." When you serve the Lord with
the right attitude, God promises to prosper you. If your heart is not
right, church can be a discouraging place, where you only see what's
wrong. Is your heart right with God?
