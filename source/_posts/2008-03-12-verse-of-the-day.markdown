_Isaiah 55:8  
For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my
ways, saith the LORD._

You may not understand God&rsquo;s reasoning in every area of your
life, but He asks you to trust Him. It&rsquo;s comforting to know
that the Source of all wisdom can be your personal guide today! When
you trust Him, He promises to bless your life.
