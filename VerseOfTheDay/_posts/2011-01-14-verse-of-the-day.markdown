_Hebrews 4:12  
For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any
two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
thoughts and intents of the heart._

The WORD of God, the Bible, is not a work of religious literature.
It is living and powerful and active in the lives of those who will
embrace it regularly. The truth found in the Scriptures can set the
most hopeless prisoner free and can convict a saint of hidden sin.
It's powerful!! You can't afford to not listen to God's WORDS, they
were written just for you today!
