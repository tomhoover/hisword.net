_Proverbs 31:10  
Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies._

It&rsquo;s Mother&rsquo;s Day! Evidently, back in Solomon&rsquo;s
day, it was hard to find a God-fearing woman who had moral values. It
is even harder to find one today. If your mother is or was that kind
of woman, you should thank God and her!
