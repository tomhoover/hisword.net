title: November 9th - Partnership with God in Prayer

_Luke 18:1b  
Men ought always to pray, and not to faint._

Have you had a day lately, where you felt like everything was
coming in on you and you just wanted to quit? You do okay with the
first two trials, but when the third one comes, you find yourself
wavering. Maybe that's where you are today. It's on days like this,
we must remember that we are not alone. Don't faint, pray! Get on
your knees and connect with your partner, Jesus Christ. He will carry
your burden and renew your mind.
