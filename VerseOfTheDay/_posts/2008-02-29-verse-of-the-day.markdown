title: February 29th - God's Place of Presence
---

_Jeremiah 1:8  
Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee,
saith the LORD._

This is a special day. It only comes around once every four years.
Make it a special day in your life, also. Go in God&rsquo;s boldness
and share the gospel with someone who doesn&rsquo;t know Christ. Make
it a special day for someone that they will never forget! The Lord
goes with you!
