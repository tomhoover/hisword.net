title: August 11th - Extreme Love...hopes and believes the best.

_Psalm 146:5  
Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is
in the LORD his God._

Happy! Does that describe you today? If your HOPE is in the LORD
GOD, you can be happy. Of course, this always involves a choice on
your part. You can believe the promises of God, or just trust in your
fleshly abilities. Make HOPE a part of your life today, and it will
put a smile on your face.
