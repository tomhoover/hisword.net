title: July 28th - Partnership with God in Sacrifice
---

_Luke 17:33  
Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever
shall lose his life shall preserve it._

You must be willing at any time to sacrifice who you are presently,
to become something better through the power of Jesus Christ. You must
get rid of the old, to make room for the new. This is a good day to
clean your spiritual closets out!
