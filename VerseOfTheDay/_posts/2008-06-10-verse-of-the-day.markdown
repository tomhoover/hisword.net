title: June 10th - God&rsquo;s Place of Peace
---

_Isaiah 32:17-18  
And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of
righteousness quietness and assurance forever. And my people shall
dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet
resting places._

Good Morning! Do you enjoy quiet moments of peace at the top of
your day? Some days start with a loud bang, and quiet can elude you.
No matter. Find a quiet place and ask God to help you to do and say
the right things today. You will be amazed at the peace that comes
upon you.
