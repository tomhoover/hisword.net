title: February 8th - Extreme Love...is gracious, not rude.
---

_II Thessalonians 2:16-17  
Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which
hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good
hope through grace, Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every
good word and work._

At the root of all good things upon this earth, is the extreme love
of God. There is nothing ordinary about God's love. His Love pierced
through the heavens and took on flesh in the form of His Son. Jesus
graciously gave His life so that you might have the hope of eternal
life. As you go throughout your day, reflect upon God's extreme great
love and how it has touched your life! Then share a good word or good
deed with those around you, and tell them that God loves them too!
