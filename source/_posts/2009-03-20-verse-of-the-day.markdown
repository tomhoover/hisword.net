_I John 3:1  
Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us
not, because it knew him not._

Someone said, /"Love is the expression of concern for another
person, that makes you willing to sacrifice your own desires for
their good."/ There are a lot of people who don't know that this is
what God did when He sent His Son to this earth. Will you give a
sacrifice of your time today to touch the life of someone who doesn't
know what God has done for them?
