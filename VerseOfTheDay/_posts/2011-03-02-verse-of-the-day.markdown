_Hebrews 12:2  
Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the
joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame,
and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God._

The greatest example of "finished FAITH" has to be our Lord Jesus
Christ. Our verse tells us that in spite of all the pain and shame He
endured, it was joyful for Him to do this for you! Is there anything
that you are going through that compares to Calvary? Ask God to help
you have JOY in the midst of your struggles, and be determined to
finish this life FULL of FAITH! Someone is watching your life.
