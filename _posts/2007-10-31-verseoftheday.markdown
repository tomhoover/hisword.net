_Psalm 65:4  
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto
thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the
goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple._

When you put God first in your life, and serve Him through His
church, God will bless you beyond imagination.
