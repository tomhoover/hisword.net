_Hebrews 11:31  
By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not,
when she had received the spies with peace._

What an encouraging verse! ANYONE who places their FAITH in His
Son, Jesus Christ, will not perish, but have everlasting life!
Someday we will talk with Rahab in heaven and she will tell us how
everything around her was dramatically destroyed! She will tell us
that she was saved by FAITH! Have you forgotten the power of FAITH to
rescue and change a life?
