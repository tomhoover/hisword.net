_Romans 4:7  
Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose
sins are covered._

Norman Cousins said, "Life is an adventure in forgiveness." Were it
not for God's forgiveness, your life might be very different. There is
not a day that you do not need God's forgiveness. When you deny
forgiveness, you are stuck in time. When you embrace forgiveness,
life becomes an exciting adventure throughout eternity!
