_II Corinthians 4:18  
While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things
which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but
the things which are not seen are eternal._

Have you found that the "human side" of your life most often rules
you? You constantly must re-adjust your world view in order for the
"spiritual part" of your life to have the pre-eminence. Our verse for
today reminds you once again, that the spiritual world is more real
and more important than the physical things you presently touch.
Would you ask God to help bring this verse of scripture to
remembrance throughout this day?
