title: December 15th - Partnership with God in Personal Finances

_I Timothy 6:17  
Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who
giveth us richly all things to enjoy._

An unknown author said, "The best way for a person to have happy
thoughts is to count His blessings and not his money." If you are
busy trying to think about all your blessings, you will not be pulled
toward the desire to acquire riches.
