title: June 1st - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith
---

_Hebrews 11:6  
But without faith it is impossible to please Him; for he that cometh
to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that
diligently seek Him._

The voices of this world insist that God doesn't exist because they
can't see Him. Christians say that through faith, they can see God!
Initial faith is only the beginning of a great adventure through the
"incredible and impossible." The Christian life can be exciting and
miraculous, when you believe that He is. Where will your FAITH take
you today? Prepare your heart for a great adventure!
