_Titus 2:11-12  
11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all
men,  
12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world._

One of the wonderful things that God intended for a church to do,
is to teach the truth of His Word to people. If you have someone who
faithfully teaches God's Word in your life, you should thank God, and
then take the time to thank him or her. Your Partner wants to connect
you with His truth. He cares about you!
