title: August 26th - God&rsquo;s Place of Faithfulness
---

_I Corinthians 10:13  
There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but
God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye
are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape,
that ye may be able to bear it._

Why repeat the sins and mistakes of yesterday? God has promised to
give you a way out, a way to escape the temptation that tripped you
up yesterday! Purpose in your heart to do right today, and pray for
God&rsquo;s power to enable you. God says, &ldquo;You can do it with
His help!&rdquo;
