title: July 4th - God&rsquo;s Place of Salvation
---

_John 8:32  
And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free._

If you know and have experienced the truth of God&rsquo;s saving
grace, you really have something to celebrate today. This is a day in
which US citizens celebrate freedom for our country. If Jesus Christ
is in your heart, you can celebrate freedom from the condemnation of
sin. Hallelujah, what a Savior!
