title: March 8th - Extreme Love...is giving.
---

_Proverbs 23:26  
My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways._

Some people would rather give their possessions than to have to
give their heart away. What do you have that God would want? The
greatest gift you can give God, is that of your heart. This means
that you put all your trust in Him alone. When you give God ownership
of your heart, you will want to obey Him. This will include giving Him
your eyes, a picture of surrendering your selfish desires. Does God
have your heart? This is the gift that God wants you to give Him,
every day of your life!
