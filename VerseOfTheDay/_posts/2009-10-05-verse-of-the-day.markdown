_Psalm 40:1  
I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard
my cry._

Have you been praying about something for a long time, and it just
seems like God is never going to give you the answer you desire? Our
verse reminds us that not only does God have a part in answered
prayer, you do also. God's part is that He has heard your request and
He is involved in the answer. Your part is to be patient and
faithfully wait on His timing.
