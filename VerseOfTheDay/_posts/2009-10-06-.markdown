title: October 6th - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_Hebrews 12:1  
Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud
of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth
so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set
before us._

Imagine, if you will ... the invisible ... those that have gone on
to heaven ... looking down upon you today, with smiles of
encouragement. If they could speak to you, they would tell you to
cleanse your life of sin, and patiently keep serving the Lord. They
would tell you that heaven is so worth all the sacrifices you are
called to make! They would tell you, be patient, the best is yet to
come!
