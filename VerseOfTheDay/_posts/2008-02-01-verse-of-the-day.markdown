title: February 1st - God's Place of Presence
---

_Psalm 46:1  
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble._

When you woke up this morning, did you talk to God? As you go
through your day, troubles often surface that can destroy the peace
of God's presence in your life. Call upon God early before trouble
shows up.
