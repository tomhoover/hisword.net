title: May 20th - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.
---

_Ephesians 4:32  
And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another,
even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you._

Forgiving others can be a most difficult thing to do. It goes
against human nature to act lovingly to someone who has offended us.
Only God's grace working in your life, through faith, can enable you
to do this. When you can be kind and forgiving to those who offend
you, it demonstrates that God is at work in your heart.
