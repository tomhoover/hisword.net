_Romans 8:28  
And we know that all things work together for good to them that love
God, to them who are the called according to his purpose._

How many times have you had someone quote this verse to you? It can
seem trite, if you don't have real FAITH in God! The truth is, most of
the time, instead of looking for the good, we are too busy complaining
about the bad! Ask GOD to help you see the "good" in your trials, and
then renew your heart to serve Him!
