title: October 2nd - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_Hebrews 6:12  
That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and
patience inherit the promises._

There has never been a generation upon this earth that has not had
to wait at some time on God's promises to be fulfilled. God has
promised to reward those who wait patiently upon Him. Patience is
taking your hands off, looking up to God, and letting Him fill in the
blanks. It's waiting on God to do things, His way, in His time.
