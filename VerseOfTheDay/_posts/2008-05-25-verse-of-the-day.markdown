_I John 5:5  
Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that
Jesus is the Son of God?_

Do you believe that Jesus is the Son of God? If you do, you are one
of the most blessed people upon this earth! You are a child of the
King! Don&rsquo;t let the voice of this world pull you down today.
Focus on our powerful Savior!
