_Matthew 5:10  
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven._

EXTREME!! Our verse demands an extreme attitude (joy), for an
extreme action (persecution). It's saying that you are privileged to
be able to suffer for Christ's sake, and you should rejoice in being
able to do this for the LORD. And if that's not enough, you are given
an extreme reward when you can rejoice in the midst of your trials!
EXTREME?? Only if you live for this life!
