_Psalm 140:7  
O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my
head in the day of battle._

Is your head covered? When you are in a battle, you need to protect
your head. The shield of the Eternal is a better protection than a
helmet of brass. When the enemy attacks, call upon the power of the
Almighty to cover you. God reminds us that we will be in a battle
until He returns for us! Be ready!
