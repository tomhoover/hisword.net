title: January 29th - Extreme Love...Is not proud or self-focused
---

_John 13:35  
By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love
one to another._

The challenge for today is to make your life different from the
norm. EXTREME LOVE is something that really stands out in the midst
of an impatient society. The world expects Christians to be different
and to LOVE differently than others. If someone observed your life
today would they see LOVE?
