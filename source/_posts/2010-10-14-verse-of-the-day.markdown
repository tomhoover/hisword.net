_II Kings 4:3-6  
Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors,
even empty vessels; borrow not a few. And when thou art come in, thou
shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out
into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.
So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons,
who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out. And it came to
pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring
me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more.
And the oil stayed._

It was an exciting day in the life of this widow when she opened
the door and God walked in! She was at the end of all her resources.
We can see ourselves in the life of this woman. Have you done all you
can do and it's not enough? Open the door of FAITH and invite God
inside. Fill yourself with His presence and promises. You are the
vessel that He longs to fill. If you are FULL of yourself, there will
be no room for FAITH!
