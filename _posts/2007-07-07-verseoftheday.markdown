_Numbers 6:24-25  
24 The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:  
25 The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto
thee:_

Verse 25 is an allusion to the shining of the sun upon the earth,
to enlighten and comfort it, and to renew the face of it. Spiritually
we need the light of God to shine upon us, to illuminate our path, and
to "comfort us in all our tribulation" as we seek to follow His
precepts and to perform His will.
