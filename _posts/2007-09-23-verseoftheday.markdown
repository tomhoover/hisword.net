_Romans 15:4  
For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our
learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures
might have hope._

The writer of Hebrews tells us in Hebrews 12:1, that the record of
the "great cloud of witnesses (of faith)" are written to inspire us
as Christians to resist sin and to reset our focus on surrendering to
our Savior, all by faith. The hope spoken of in our verse only
benefits us if we walk by faith, being driven, not by the things we
see, but by the things that we know to be true by the Word of God.
