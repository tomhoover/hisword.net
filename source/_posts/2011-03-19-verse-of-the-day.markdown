_Hebrews 11:29  
By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the
Egyptians assaying to do were drowned._

They saw the Red Sea parted! They walked on the dry land between
the walls of water! Their enemies were swallowed up! They witnessed
water coming from the rock in the desert! They ate mysterious food
that was provided for them every day! They experienced some of God's
greatest miracles, but they forgot! Their FAITH was challenged every
day, for forty years, and they became fearful! Sometimes we think if
we had experienced all these miracles, our FAITH would be different.
We would never forget God's power! But have you forgotten? The names
that were written in Hebrews 11 are there because they endured to the
end! Make a note: Your FAITH will be continually challenged!
