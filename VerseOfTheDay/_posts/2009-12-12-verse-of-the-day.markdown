_I Timothy 6:10  
For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some
coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves
through with many sorrows._

We are admonished in the Bible to be good stewards of our money. It
isn't wrong to have money, but it is wrong to let money be your
motivation for living. Contrary to the opinions of many, life is not
about making and spending money. If that's your focus, you will be
greatly disappointed one day. Invest your time and money in God's
work, today, as it is a sound investment!
