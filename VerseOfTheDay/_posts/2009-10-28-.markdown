title: October 28th - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_Romans 15:5  
Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded
one toward another according to Christ Jesus._

When you show patience in your relationships with one another, the
love of Christ Jesus is supremely displayed. If you will focus on
this truth today, it might salvage a relationship, and change a life.
In this world of extremes, we can only love too little. The God of
Extreme LOVE and patience, encourages you to be like Him today.
