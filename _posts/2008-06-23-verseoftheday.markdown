title: June 23rd - God&rsquo;s Place of Peace
---

_Isaiah 48:18  
O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace
been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea._

Throughout your day you will come in contact with water in various
forms. There wouldn&rsquo;t be any coffee without water. You
couldn&rsquo;t clean your dishes or clothes without water. You need
water every day! Peace and righteousness are pictured as water in
different forms, and we are made to see the importance of them in our
lives also. Every time you see water today, be reminded of the
importance of a righteous life, which brings peace.
