_Psalm 73:17  
Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their
end._

We can become so hard-hearted and self-focused at times, that is,
until we go to God's house and hear His message. It is His Word that
gives us understanding, encouragement, and the rebuke we need to get
our eyes off ourselves and onto God and others. Find sanctuary in a
quiet moment with God today.
