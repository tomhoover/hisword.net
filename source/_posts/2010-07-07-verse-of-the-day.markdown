_Romans 4:20  
He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was
strong in faith, giving glory to God._

Abraham was convinced at this point in his life that God was
capable and reliable to do what He said He would. God had brought
Abraham through some very difficult situations, and his faith had
grown to the place where he could give God the glory before the fact.
Has God brought you through some difficult places in your life? Maybe
you are in one right now. You can TRUST God! His promises never fail!
Give Him the glory for what He's going to accomplish in your life!
