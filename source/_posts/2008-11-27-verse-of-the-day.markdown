_Philippians 4:6  
Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication
with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God._

How do you break negative thought patterns? Accompany a "thank you"
with every concern you prayerfully give to God. If you will use this
as a model for your prayers, it will help you think differently. Find
the good in everything, and thank God for it. Prayer isn't about
changing things in your life as much, as it is about changing you.
