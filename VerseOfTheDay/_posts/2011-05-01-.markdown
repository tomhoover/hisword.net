_II Corinthians 12:9-10  
And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my
strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I
rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest
upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for
when I am weak, then am I strong._

Traditionally, the first day of May is called "May Day!" It began
as a pagan holiday associated with spring flowers and May poles, but
later it was Christianized and celebrated with "May Baskets." These
baskets were filled with flowers and sweets, then left anonymously on
the doorsteps of those in need. Do you have needs in your life?
In our verse God gives the gift of grace to every needy person. He
promises that when you embrace Him, with your weakness, He will give
you the strength to stand. The apostle Paul said that knowing that
God's power would graciously rest upon him, made him welcome needy
situations. Have you accepted God's grace and allowed Him to
strengthen you? He promised strength for the weak and needy! This is
God's May Day!
