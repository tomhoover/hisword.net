_Matthew 24:35  
Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass
away._

The words of Jesus, as part of the Word of God, are eternal words
without which we would have no hope. Words like, /"and him that
cometh to me I will in no wise cast out,"/ and, /"And if I go and
prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto
myself; that where I am, there ye may be also,"/ are unmatched in the
universe. And as you serve the Lord in a perverse world, how about
these words of Jesus, /"I am with you alway, even unto the end of the
world. Amen."/
