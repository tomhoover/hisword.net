_Philippians 1:6  
Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good
work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ._

You haven't arrived yet! There are still some changes that need to
be made in your life to make you more like Jesus. With this in mind,
things might go better for you today if you would just start the day
by asking Him to show you how to be more like Him. It might be less
painful too!
