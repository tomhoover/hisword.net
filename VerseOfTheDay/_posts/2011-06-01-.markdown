_Proverbs 3:5-6  
Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own
understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct
thy paths._

Self-sufficiency and self-dependence have been the ruin of mankind
ever since the fall of Adam. We try to live independently of God and
work out our own problems until we hit a "dead-end." Why not start
with God? Trusting God means giving Him all of it, not just a part.
Does this mean you can't use your mind? No, God gave you that mind,
but you must fill that mind with His Words, not your fleshly
reasoning. When you call upon Him for direction, He promises to guide
you, knowing what's best for you.
