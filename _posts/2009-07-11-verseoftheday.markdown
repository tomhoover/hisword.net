_II Corinthians 12:9  
And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my
strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I
rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest
upon me._

You may be going through a hard time in your life right now and
feeling overwhelmed. Be assured, if you have Jesus Christ in your
heart, your weakness can be transformed. As you call upon the God of
all comfort, recognize that suffering makes your fellowship with Him
so very sweet. Your circumstances may not change, but the power of
His grace changes your attitude, leaving strength where weakness once
ruled!
