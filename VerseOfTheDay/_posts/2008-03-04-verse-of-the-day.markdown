_II Corinthians 9:8  
And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always
having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work._

The promise of God&rsquo;s grace is not something you should take
lightly. In appreciation, look for someone today, to whom you could
show God&rsquo;s grace. Put the needs of others before your own.
