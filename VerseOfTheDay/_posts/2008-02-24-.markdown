_Proverbs 18:24  
A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a
friend that sticketh closer than a brother._

Have you made any new friends lately? Everyone needs to be making
new friends all the time. What if Jesus had only been a friend to a
few? Get out of yourself and your comfortable relationships, and make
a new friend today!
