_Galatians 6:2  
Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ._

It's the law! Did you read it? God has put some people in your life
who are bearing heavy burdens, who need your help. They might be
care-givers, bread-winners, or the financially destitute. You might
not be able to personally meet all their needs, but you can encourage
them with your presence and prayers. You fulfill the law when you care
enough to get involved in their lives! It's the law!
