_Isaiah 11:6  
The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie
down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling
together; and a little child shall lead them._

However good life can get here, and in Christ, it can be wonderful;
for those who live on this earth when Jesus Christ is ruling and
reigning with His saints from Jerusalem, well, to use bad English, it
doesn&rsquo;t get any gooder than that. There will be peace in this
world that we can never experience this side of the Second Coming of
Christ the King. Would you lay down and sleep today next to a lion?
