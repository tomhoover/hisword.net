_Hebrews 11:21  
By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of
Joseph; and worshiped, leaning upon the top of his staff._

In our verse, we are given two things that Jacob learned about
FAITH as God tried him! "Leaning upon the top of his staff" expresses
his human weakness, and that he came to understand that He could not
live by FAITH with out God's help! The phrase "blessed both the sons
of Joseph and worshiped," revealed that God blessed him in the midst
of the trials of life, and because of God's love and mercy, he
worshiped Him! What about you? Are you leaning on the Lord in the
midst of your trial, and can you see God's blessing?
