_Revelation 1:3  
Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this
prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the
time is at hand._

Need a blessing today? You are promised a blessing just for reading
God's WORD!! Now, that's not too hard, or is it? The ball is in your
court! Be aware of your part if you want God's blessing upon your
life! It's called a FAITH-BOOK-BLESSING!
