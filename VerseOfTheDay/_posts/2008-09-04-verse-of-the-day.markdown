_Psalm 51:3  
For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me._

If you want a right relationship with God, and ask Him to reveal
sin in your life, He will help you see your sin. When you admit your
sin to God, you are more than half way to His Place of forgiveness.
Restore your relationship today, as God is standing in the road
looking for you.
