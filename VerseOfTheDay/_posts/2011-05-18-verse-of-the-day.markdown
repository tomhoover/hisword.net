_Psalm 17:3  
Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou
hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth
shall not transgress._

God is searching for hearts that will trust Him. He often visits us
in the night times, or the dark and difficult times of our lives. He
is listening to hear if you will praise Him or curse Him. May your
prayer be that of the psalmist: "I am purposed that my mouth shall
not transgress!"
