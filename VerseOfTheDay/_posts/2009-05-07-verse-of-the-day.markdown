_II Chronicles 7:14  
If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves,
and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then
will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal
their land._

It doesn't matter who you voted for last November, you must pray
for them and your nation! If more people would pray passionately for
their nation to spiritually turn back to God on a daily basis,
instead of complaining, it would truly make a difference. Does one
prayer make a difference with God? Ask Daniel! It delivered him from
the lions' den, and changed his nation. Seek God's face today! Your
prayers and attitude can make a difference!
