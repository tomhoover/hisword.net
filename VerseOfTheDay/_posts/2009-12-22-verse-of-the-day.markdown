_I John 4:10  
Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and
sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins._

EXTREME LOVE! This is the kind of love that purposely embraces
everyone, ignoring their indifference and rejection. Extreme love
puts a high value on the lives of people, understanding that
sacrifice is worth more than any personal gain. Thank you, God, for
demonstrating this kind of love, through Your Son. Help me to love
others with Your Extreme Love!
