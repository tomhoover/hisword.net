_I John 1:7-8  
But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son
cleanseth us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us._

Someone said, "If you don't want the fruits of sin in your life,
stay out of the Devil's orchard!" Everyone, if they are honest, has a
besetting sin. There is something in the life of everyone, if left
unchecked, could pull them down and away from the presence of the
LIGHT. An indicator that you aren't walking in the LIGHT, is when you
have broken your fellowship with God and man. Confess your sin and get
back in the SON-SHINE!
