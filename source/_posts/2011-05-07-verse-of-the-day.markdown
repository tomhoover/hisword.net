_Psalm 91:15  
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in
trouble; I will deliver him, and honor him._

There it is! The phrase, "I will be with HIM in trouble!" Have you
forgotten that GOD is with you? Have you forgotten His promise to
deliver you? Call on HIM! The "prayer-lines" are open and waiting for
your call!
