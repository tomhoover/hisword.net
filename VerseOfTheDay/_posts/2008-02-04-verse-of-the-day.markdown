_Isaiah 43:2  
When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest
through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame
kindle upon thee._

The water and fire in our verse represent things of which we are
fearful. You can find yourself fearful of people, financial
difficulties, or health concerns. God is still delivering His people,
no matter the fear. God will do mighty things for you, when you TRUST
Him.
