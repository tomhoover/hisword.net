title: June 28th - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith
---

_Isaiah 58:11  
And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in
drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shall be like a watered
garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not._

There may be a part of your life that is dry and desolate in need
of a drink of refreshing water. Perhaps you've had a dream shattered
or suffered a broken heart. Maybe your life is full of stress or just
the opposite, lonely and boring. God might seem distant and far from
you. Don&rsquo;t despair! God has "living water" that will bring your
heart and soul back to life! Ask Him in FAITH to fill you with His
Presence again. His water fails not&ndash; the drought can be
broken.
