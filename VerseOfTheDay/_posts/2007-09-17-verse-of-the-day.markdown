_Jeremiah 24:7  
And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and
they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall
return unto me with their whole heart._

If you have been saved, you have a new heart, regenerated by the
Holy Spirit by the miracle of the New Birth. By the power of
God&rsquo;s Spirit within, you are able to give God your whole heart
and love Him above all else. How do you know if you love Him? Jesus
said, "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that
loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I
will love him, and will manifest myself to him." (John 14:21)
