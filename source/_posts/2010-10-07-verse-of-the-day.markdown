_John 20:28  
And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God._

Do you ever praise and acknowledge God audibly in the presence of
others? This is what Thomas was asked to do in our verse. Jesus
already knew His heart, but He knew that Thomas needed to vocalize
his FAITH to benefit himself and others. Every time we speak our
FAITH in God, it strengthens us and FILLS the vacuum of doubt present
in this world. Purpose to speak your FAITH at least three times today!
It's powerful!
