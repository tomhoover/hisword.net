_Psalm 139:14  
I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well._

Did you know? Within the human body, there are 75,000 miles worth
of blood vessels; that&rsquo;s enough to go around the earth 3 times.
Your brain makes a thousand million computations in the second it
takes to read this sentence. Your ear has about a million moving
parts. Your nose can determine 10,000 different smells. Your body has
450 &ldquo;touch cells&rdquo; per square inch. The heart, in an
average lifetime, beats 2.5 billion times, without rest. Only the
Creator can take care of something so intricately designed. Next time
something &ldquo;hurts,&rdquo; go to Him first. God cares.
