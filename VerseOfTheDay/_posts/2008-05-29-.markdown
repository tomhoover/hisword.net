title: May 29th - God&rsquo;s Place of Victory
---

_Nehemiah 4:20  
In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye
thither unto us: our God shall fight for us._

Did your alarm clock go off this morning? That was your reminder to
get up and get going. Every so often, God gives us a trumpet call to
remind us that we need to get back in line with Him. God does His
best work in our lives when we are in our place in His army.
