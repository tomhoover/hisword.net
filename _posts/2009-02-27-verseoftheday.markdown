_Ephesians 4:29  
Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that
which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto
the hearers._

Someone said, "If you can't say anything good, don't say anything
at all." You can show God's grace to others by just keeping your
mouth shut and not sharing your opinion sometimes. Think about your
words today before you say them. Do your words build up or tear
down?
