_Matthew 4:10b  
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou
serve._

Don't let the busyness of your life pull you away from your
agreement to love and serve the Lord thy God. Every morning you must
purpose to remember that you represent and serve God above everyone
and everything else. This is the key to dealing with a busy life,
without letting the stress of this world pull you down.
