_I Corinthians 15:57  
But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord
Jesus Christ._

It's spring, and the flowers are reminding us of how God quickens
the earth to bring forth life. As you go throughout your day, look
for God's beauty in your world, and stop and thank God for what He's
given you. Your life is full of blessings that you ignore every day.
Most of all thank God for Jesus Christ Who has given us the
victory!
