_Matthew 9:36  
But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on
them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep
having no shepherd._

Sheep without a shepherd in Palestine were soon to die from a fall,
starve to death, or become a part of a wolf&rsquo;s happy meal.
Without a shepherd, a sheep is in peril. Without the safety and
security that is only found by faith in Christ, people&rsquo;s
eternal souls are in peril. We, as believers in His churches, are
commissioned and commanded to go out into the fields where these
shepherdless sheep are and show them the way into the sheepfold
through repentance of sin and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
