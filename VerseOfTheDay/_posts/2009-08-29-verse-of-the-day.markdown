_I John 4:13  
Hereby know we that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because He hath
given us of His Spirit._

Have you felt God's presence in your life today? When a Christian
reads their Bible, the Holy Spirit "highlights" words or phrases that
are especially meaningful for the individual, and brings them back to
their mind. This is just one of the ways we can know God is with us
and guiding us. He also uses His Word to encourage us to change our
ways.
