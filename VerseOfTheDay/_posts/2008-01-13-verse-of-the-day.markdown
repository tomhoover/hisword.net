_Psalm 62:11  
God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth
unto God._

We need to be reminded, more than once, that the power to
accomplish anything in this life belongs to God, and not us. Ask God
to show His power in your life today, and get ready to see something
great happen.
