title: August 27th - God&rsquo;s Place of Faithfulness
---

_I Thessalonians 5:24  
Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it._

God has called all of us to do something for Him. What has God
called you to do? What are the gifts that He has given you to use for
Him? Purpose to use your gifts for God today and watch Him work
through you.
