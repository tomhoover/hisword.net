title: May 27th - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.
---

_Romans 12:21  
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good._

When you let yourself indulge in evil, you will become conquered by
evil. On the other hand, when you can find it in yourself to do good,
you will get the victory. With God's help, the hearts of the most
stubborn can change. You no longer have an enemy when you ask God to
make him your friend. Do good today! It's God&rsquo;s way!
