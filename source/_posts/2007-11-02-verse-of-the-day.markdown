_Matthew 25:35-36  
35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye
gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:  
36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in
prison, and ye came unto me._

Take a moment to praise God for His care and provision in every
area of your life! Then ask God to put someone in your life today who
is thirsty.
