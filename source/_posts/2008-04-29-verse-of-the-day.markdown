_Isaiah 46:4  
And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I
carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will
deliver you._

If you have ever walked for a long time, you have had the thought
of wanting someone to carry you. As you get older that thought can
become a worry. God wants you to know, that no matter your age, He
will take care of you. The strong arms that made the world, hold you
up today!
