title: February 3rd - Partnership with God in Loving Relationships
---

_Romans 15:5  
Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded
one toward another according to Christ Jesus._

There is not a day upon this earth where everything goes totally
right with every situation and relationship in your life. Don't be
discouraged, you aren't living in a perfect world, yet! If you will
ask for your Partner's help, He will give you the patience and
encouragement to keep going. Drop to your knees and ask God to help
you.
