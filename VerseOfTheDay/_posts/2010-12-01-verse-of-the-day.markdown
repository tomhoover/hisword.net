_II Samuel 22:29  
For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my
darkness._

This is the first day of one of the busiest months of your year.
For many people, it will be all about gifts and material possessions.
Hopefully, if you are a Christian, your focus will be different. To
think differently in the midst of your culture will take some WORK on
your part! Ask God right now to help you focus on the "LIGHT," Jesus,
who pierced through the heavens, illuminating the darkness of this
earth. FAITH in this LIGHT, Jesus, will keep the darkness out of your
busy month.
