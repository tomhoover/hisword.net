_Matthew 15:28  
Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith:
be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole
from that very hour._

Has anyone ever told you that you had "great faith?" That is not
something that is said very often in this day and age. What made this
woman's FAITH so different from the average Christian's? Was her FAITH
great because she was totally at the end of human help? Possibly. Or
was it that her FAITH's object was not in the healing, but instead in
the Man who healed? This is where most of us get off course in our
FAITH. Our focus is on the problem, not the Problem-solver! Great
FAITH begins when you forget about your needs and focus on your
SAVIOR!
