_II Timothy 1:7  
For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
love, and of a sound mind._

Someone said, "If you realized how powerful your thoughts are, you
would never think a negative thought again!" There is so much truth
in this statement! When those thoughts of fear, doubt, and worry come
into your mind, you must not let them linger! Replace them with
reflections of God's power and love! This is how you keep a sound
mind in an insane world! FAITH-LIFT: It overcomes fear through God's
power!
