title: May 11th - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.

_II Corinthians 10:4-5  
For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through
God to the pulling down of strong holds; Casting down imaginations,
and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of
God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of
Christ._

There is a spiritual battle that goes on every day in the thought
life of the believer. Pulling down strongholds, or wrong thoughts and
perceptions, is something we all need God's help to be able to do. We
are reminded that it begins when we choose to cast down the lies of
this world and replace them with the truth that comes from God's
Word. Your weapons are not carnal, but spiritual. Fight this battle
with God's help and THINK on things above!
