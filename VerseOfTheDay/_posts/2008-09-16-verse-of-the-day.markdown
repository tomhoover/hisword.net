_I John 4:10  
Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and
sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins._

Love and forgiveness are requirements for every relationship. If
you have trouble forgiving, then you will have problem with
relationships. The basis for your relationship with God is built upon
His unconditional love for you. He gave His best, Jesus, for the sins
of the lovely and unlovely. Ask God to help you love and forgive the
people in your life.
