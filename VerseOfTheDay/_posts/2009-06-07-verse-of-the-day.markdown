_Matthew 17:20b  
If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this
mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and
nothing shall be impossible unto you._

It has been said, "Faith can move mountains, but don't be surprised
if God hands you a shovel!" Most of the challenging situations we find
ourselves in during this lifetime are about growing our faith and
making it stronger. Sometimes God is waiting to see if you will pick
up the shovel, or obey what He asks you to do, before he removes your
mountain. Absolutely nothing is impossible when you partner with
God!
