_I Thessalonians 5:16  
Rejoice evermore._

Okay, this is a "no excuse" day! No matter what happens, good or
bad, purpose to rejoice and praise the Lord throughout your whole
day! You may need to ask the Lord to help you if you tend to see the
glass half-empty most of the time. You may need to write the word
"rejoice" on a card and keep it with you all day. Don't blow this
off. Give God just one full day of rejoicing!
