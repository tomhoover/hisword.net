_Matthew 7:7  
Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock,
and it shall be opened unto you._

There are three action words in our verse today: ask, seek, knock.
They picture a person who progressively gets serious in their prayers
with God. If you are in need of a word from God today, ask, seek, and
knock, persistently. You may not get your concept of an answer, but
it will open up a closer relationship and awareness of God's presence
in your life, which is always part of God's answer.
