_Psalm 51:12  
Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy
free spirit._

Do you have a joyful heart today? Sometimes Christians can forget
about that wonderful moment when Jesus came into their lives, and
changed their world. Take a moment to go back in your mind to that
moment. Do you remember the joy? Take that joy with wherever you go
today! It&rsquo;s contagious!
