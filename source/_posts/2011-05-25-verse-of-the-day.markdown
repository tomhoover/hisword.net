_Psalm 7:9  
Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish
the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins._

Have you noticed that justice isn't always observed instantly? It
may be years before God's fulfillment comes to light, but it will
happen. God is FAITHFULL to keep His Word, so you better keep yours!
May demonstrated grace define your heart today!
