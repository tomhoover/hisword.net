_Psalm 25:5  
Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my
salvation; on Thee do I wait all the day._

Are you waiting on God to answer a prayer or do something specific
in your life? Could it be that God is waiting on you? Bow your head,
and ask God to guide you into the truth that He is waiting on you to
learn. By deferring to God, you could be saving yourself a lot of
pain and heartache.
