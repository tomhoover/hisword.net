_Romans 13:11  
And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of
sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we first believed._

It is a fact. You are one day closer to eternity than you were
yesterday. Make your day count! Do something for God that will make a
difference in eternity for someone else and yourself!
