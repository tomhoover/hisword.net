_Matthew 9:29  
Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it
unto you._

If your FAITH was measured or graphed on a life chart, it probably
would surprise you. When your emotions are good, it would peak, but
what about the bad days? Our verse reminds us that the outcome of our
circumstances hinges on the proportion of our FAITH. FAITH should be
present in the good and bad days. In other words, God wants to do His
part, but He's waiting on you to believe in Him! May you live and
speak FAITH every day!
