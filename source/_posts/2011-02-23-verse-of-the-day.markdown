_Psalm 103:11  
For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy
toward them that fear him._

God's mercy and grace is immeasurable, but our verse qualifies it.
It is abundant to those who have respect and FAITH in Him. God's
people, the nation of Israel, were taught this principle repeatedly.
When they put their FAITH in Him, God mercifully fought their
battles! When they turned their back on God, they were overcome. Do
you need some mercy in your life today? Put your FAITH in GOD!
