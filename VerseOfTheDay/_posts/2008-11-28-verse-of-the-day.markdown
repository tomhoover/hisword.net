title: November 28th - Partnership with God in Prayer
---

_Psalm 86:6  
Give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my
supplications._

Should you bother God when you lose your car keys? God wants you to
pray about everything that concerns you, interests you, confuses you,
frightens you, or in any way touches or challenges your life. God has
called us to be people of prayer, even when it comes to small things!
Regular communication about even the small things in your life will
build a bond of intimate fellowship with the all powerful Savior.
