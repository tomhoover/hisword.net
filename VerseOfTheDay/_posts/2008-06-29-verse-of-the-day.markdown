_Psalm 147:14  
He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of
the wheat._

The older you get, the more you appreciate peace. What a wonderful
gift &ldquo;peace&rdquo; is from our loving God. When you bow your
head today to thank God for your daily bread, take a minute and thank
Him for the peace that He gives that comes from above. Do you realize
how blessed you are?
