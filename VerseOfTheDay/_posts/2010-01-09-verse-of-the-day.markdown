_Romans 14:7  
For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself._

"People Need People," is the name of a song that the world sings,
as it addresses a human need. The lyrics to this song says that we
can "let our grown up pride, hide our childlike need for others."
It's interesting that God put the need for relationships in the heart
of every human being. You were not made to live or die to yourself.
You were made for relationships. God first and others second. When
you live only to please yourself, you aren't living much of a life!
