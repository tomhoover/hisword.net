_Psalm 63:1-2  
1 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth
for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where
no water is;  
2 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
sanctuary._

When we wake in the morning our body needs water after fasting all
night. Every day our spiritual soul needs to be fed also. Call upon
God and ask Him to fill your day with a fresh awareness of His
presence.
