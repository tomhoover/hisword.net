_Galatians 5:14  
For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt
love thy neighbor as thyself._

What if you were the only person on this earth God would use to
represent Christianity? Would you be a good example of Christ? You
have been given a challenge from God's WORD today to love WHOMEVER is
placed in front of you. Now, you aren't the only person on this earth
for this test today, but you may be the ONLY person for a special
person God wants to touch. Take a step of FAITH and make LOVE your
primary expression today!
