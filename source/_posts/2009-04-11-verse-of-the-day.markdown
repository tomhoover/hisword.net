_Romans 8:11  
But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your
mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you._

Do you know? Do you know Jesus, personally? If you do, there is
nothing but victory ahead for you! A relationship with Jesus makes
every day victorious! There is nothing that can keep you down, so
don't listen to those negative words! Keep looking up, as Jesus went
up, so will you one day, if you believe in Him!
