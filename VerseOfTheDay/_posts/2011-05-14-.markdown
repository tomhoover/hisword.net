title: May 14th - FaithSearch...examining your Faith in the midst of life's
---

_I Peter 1:8-9  
Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not,
yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:
Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls._

"Receiving the end of your FAITH." What does that mean to you? It
means that there is a beginning FAITH, a middle FAITH, and an ending
FAITH! FAITH is a work in progress! The goal is to grow in FAITH,
until the day FAITH is no longer required of you! It's going to be a
glorious day, when you see JESUS face to face! Keep growing, pilgrim!
It will be worth it all!
