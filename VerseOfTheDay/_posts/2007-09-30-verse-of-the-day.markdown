_Revelation 1:7-8  
7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and
they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail
because of him. Even so, Amen.  
8 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord,
which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty._

In college, I never wanted to be attached to any ungodly Greek
letter fraternities, but being newly born again, I only wanted to be
connected to the Alpha and Omega, Jesus Christ. Christian, your best
life now is to live in the glorious hope of verse seven and the
eternal reality of verse eight. The Almighty and Eternal God has come
and He is coming again, and He will majestically and magnificently
reign with His faithful believers from Jerusalem, the city of God.
Are you ready?
