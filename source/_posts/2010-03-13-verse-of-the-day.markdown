_Romans 12:3  
For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is
among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to
think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man
the measure of faith._

We are reminded that "saving faith," is one of God's greatest gifts
to mankind. We don't deserve His love and provision anymore than
anyone else. Through God's great gift and example of humility, we are
reminded, that we should also put others before ourselves in the same
manner. Humble yourself before others, and God will bless you. Humble
people have more friends.
