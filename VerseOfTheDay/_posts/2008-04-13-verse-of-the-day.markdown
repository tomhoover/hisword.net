_Psalm 14:2  
The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if
there were any that did understand, and seek God._

The Lord looks down from heaven every Sunday and sees those who are
looking up at Him. There will always be some who understand that the
message was meant for them. If you seek God, you will find His
favor.
