_Psalm 119:90  
Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the
earth, and it abideth._

David is thanking God for His FAITHfulness upon this earth to every
generation! Just the fact that the earth is held in space by His
mighty hand should make you thank Him! The more we learn about our
universe, the more we say, "What a mighty God!" God has given you
more than the universe, He's given you His Son. Have you trusted in
Him?
"All I have seen teaches me to trust the Creator for all I have not
seen." &ndash; Ralph Waldo Emerson
