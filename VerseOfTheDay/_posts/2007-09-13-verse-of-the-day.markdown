_Psalm 91:1-2  
1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide
under the shadow of the Almighty.  
2 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in
him will I trust._

Verse one is a wonderful Hebrew parallelism. Dwell&ndash;Secret
Place &ndash;Most High is parallel to Abide-Under the Shadow-The
Almighty. The "secret place" is a protective covering and the
"shadow" is a protective shade. These are symbolic of the "fortress"
that our God provides for those who trust Him. The fortress is the
stronger word for protection, like that provided by a fort or a
castle. It is trite, almost a cliche, but the safest and most serene
place to dwell is in the center of God&rsquo;s will for your life.
