_I Corinthians 12:26  
And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or
one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it._

Christians should share in the pain as well as the happy times in
the lives of other fellow Christians within the church. Ask God to
bring someone to your mind that you could encourage through a card or
phone call.
