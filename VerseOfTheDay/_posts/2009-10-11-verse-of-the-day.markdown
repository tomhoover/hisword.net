_Isaiah 40:31  
But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they
shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be
weary; and they shall walk, and not faint._

You must make sure that your "waiting time" on the LORD is not
wasted time. While you are waiting on God, strengthen your mind with
His Word. Rehearse God's faithful promises daily, and you will renew
your strength to run and not be weary. Sometimes God will keep you in
His "waiting room," until you make your appointment to reconnect with
Him through His Word!
