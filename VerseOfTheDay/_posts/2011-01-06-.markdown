_Luke 11:28  
But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God,
and keep it._

The "He" in our verse is Jesus! He is saying that you are promised
a blessing for hearing and obeying God's WORDS! The first part isn't
too hard, but the second part, obeying, is different. It takes FAITH
to obey GOD when everything in you wants to do things your way, not
His. Be reminded as you go throughout your day, of the blessing that
will be yours when you obey God's WORDS.
