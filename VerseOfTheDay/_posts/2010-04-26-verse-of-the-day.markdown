_I Thessalonians 5:15  
See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow
that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men._

There is an old Chinese proverb that says, "If you are patient in
one moment of anger, you will escape a hundred days of sorrow." It
concurs with Bible where it says, "You will reap what you sow." Do
the right thing and treat people better than they deserve. It will
keep you from a life of sorrow and regrets.
