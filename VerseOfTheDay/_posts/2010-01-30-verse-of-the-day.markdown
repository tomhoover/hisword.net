title: January 30th - Extreme Love...Is not proud or self-focused

_Galatians 5:26  
Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying
one another._

"It is always self who gets irritable and envious, resentful,
critical, and worried. It is self who is hard and unyielding in it's
attitude to others. It is self who is shy, self-conscious and
reserved. Anything that springs from self, however small it may be,
is sin. Self-complacency in service is sin. Self-pity in trials and
difficulties, self-seeking in business or Christian work,
self-indulgence in one's spare time, sensitiveness, touchiness,
resentment, and self-defense when we are hurt or injured by others,
self- consciousness, reserve, worry, fear, all of these spring from
self and all are sin." &mdash; Roy Hession
