title: February 12th - Extreme Love...is gracious, not rude.
---

_I Peter 3:7  
Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge,
giving honor unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being
heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not
hindered._

Listen up husbands! This verse is directed to you, and with just
two days till Valentine's Day, this could be meaningful. You are
instructed to know your wife's weaknesses and to lovingly honor her
anyway. In fact if you don't do this, your prayers will be hindered
and there will be friction in your home. Wives (vs.5-6), you have
been told to submit or honor your husband, whether he's right or
wrong. Grace is treating someone better than they deserve. When both
can do this, they become "heirs together of the grace of life." This
equal expression of grace on both parts keeps you together, and
allows LOVE to grow stronger. EXTREME LOVE? Not if you want something
bad enough! Don't forget the roses!
