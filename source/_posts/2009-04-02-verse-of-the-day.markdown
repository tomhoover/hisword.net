_Isaiah 40:31  
But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they
shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be
weary; and they shall walk, and not faint._

You may presently be going through some less than wonderful times
in your life. Maybe you are just weary and wanting to give up. Your
Partner has promised to give you the strength to endure, if you will
call upon Him and trust Him. No one has a completely care free life,
but the eagle pictures the "lift" a Christian can have when he
totally trusts God.
