_Psalm 27:14  
Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine
heart: wait, I say, on the LORD._

Waiting patiently on God isn't always the fun and exciting thing to
do. If you choose to have faith and trust God patiently, He promises
to encourage your heart while you are waiting. May you have the faith
to believe and the eyes to see God's LOVE and goodness in your life
today!
