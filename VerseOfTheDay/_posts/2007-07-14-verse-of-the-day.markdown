_Psalm 73:25-26  
25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that
I desire beside thee.  
26 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my
heart, and my portion for ever._

His God would not fail Asaph, the Psalmist, either for protection
or for his portion of joy. His "Portion" means an allotment. God has
a place and a position for His children as part of their reward for
faithfulness. Our hearts, as His, will be kept up by divine love, and
filled eternally with divine glory. After having been driven far out
in the sinking sea of self pity, Asaph casts anchor in the old port
of trust and obey.
