_John 14:16-17  
16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another
Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;  
17 Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because
it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he
dwelleth with you, and shall be in you._

The "Comforter," the Holy "Spirit of truth," in these verses is the
fulfillment of the promise of Jesus to His doctrinally sound churches,
that in His absence in heaven at the Father's right hand, He will yet
be present with His people in the person of the Holy Spirit, who will
guide them into all truth. As you sacrificially serve others because
you have surrendered your life to Jesus Christ, know that the same
Jesus you love is always with you, both as an individual believer,
and in the church in which you serve.
