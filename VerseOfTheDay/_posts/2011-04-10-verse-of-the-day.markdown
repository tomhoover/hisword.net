_Psalm 63:2  
To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
sanctuary._

G. K. Chesterton said, "The church is the one thing that saves a
man from the degrading servitude of being a child of his time." There
is a glory in the presence of Jesus Christ seen when believers come
together, that will necessarily be missing in an individual pursuit
of God. The local church calls you to a higher level of
accountability and service. Jesus understands human needs and
dispositions, and that's reason He left His church behind, just for
YOU! You get something at your local church that you don't get
anywhere else! It's called FAITH-LIFT!
