_Psalm 46:1  
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble._

Storms are part of our lives. Someone observed that either we are
in the midst of a storm, just coming through a storm, or there is one
looming on the horizon. The question is, "What will you do when it
arrives?" What if we stopped telling God how big our storms are and
instead tell our storms how big our God is? You may be going through
some trial or storm right now. God has not left you. He is present to
lead, guide, and encourage your heart!
