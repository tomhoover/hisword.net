_Nehemiah 9:19  
Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the
wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to
lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew
them light, and the way wherein they should go._

To His children in the wilderness, God was the supplier of all
their sustenance, their security from the scorching sun, and their
shining light to guide their way. We live in the world's wilderness
of sin, the god of this world's domain; but we have the supply, the
security, and the shining light of the Holy Spirit of God to guide us
safely through our "pilgrim's progress" through our wilderness.
