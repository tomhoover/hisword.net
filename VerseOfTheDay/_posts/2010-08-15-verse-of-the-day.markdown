title: August 15th - Extreme Love...hopes and believes the best.
---

_Romans 5:5  
And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad
in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us._

When the world says, "It's not possible, give up!" HOPE speaks up
and says, "Hang on, because God's LOVE, makes all things possible!"
Do you hear HOPE today, or are you listening to the world?
