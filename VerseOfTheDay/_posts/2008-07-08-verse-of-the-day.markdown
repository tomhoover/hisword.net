_Isaiah 12:3  
Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of
salvation._

Have you gone to the well and drawn your water for today?
Christians are responsible for drawing their own water every day.
This is a picture of spending time with God in His Word, connecting
your heart with your Maker. As the water of His Word floods your
soul, JOY will splash upon your whole day!
