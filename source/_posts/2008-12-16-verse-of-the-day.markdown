_Isaiah 48:17  
Thus saith the Lord thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the
Lord thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the
way which thou shouldest go._

These are troubling times for the economy and finances of the whole
world. The world's financial advisors don't have any fool-proof
investment strategies. God, on the other hand, encourages us to
invest ourselves in the lives of others, which will bring a profit in
this world and the world to come.
