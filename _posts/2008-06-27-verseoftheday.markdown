title: June 27th - God&rsquo;s Place of Peace
---

_Isaiah 59:8  
The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their
goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein
shall not know peace._

Do you know where you are going today? Hopefully you won&rsquo;t
get lost, or go down a wrong road. How do you know if you are going
the wrong direction when it comes to God? Peace will leave you. Your
heart is troubled.
Monitor your &ldquo;peace level&rdquo; today, and go with God! It
will keep you off the wrong road and all those dead ends!
