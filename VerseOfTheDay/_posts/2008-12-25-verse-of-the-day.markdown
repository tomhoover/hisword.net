_II Corinthians 9:15  
Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift._

"Merry Christmas - Jesus is the reason for the season!" Did you
open your gifts this morning? Was there anything that took your
breath away? Jesus is the gift that is priceless beyond words, and
the only gift that will have value outside of this earthly realm. If
you have Jesus in your heart, you are going to have a spectacular
day!! Enjoy!
