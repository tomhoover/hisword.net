title: June 12th - Extreme Love...rejoices in truth.
---

_Psalm 85:10  
Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
kissed each other._

What would a "kiss from God" feel like? Chances are you have been
"kissed by God" and weren't even aware of it. If you possess His
TRUTH in your life, and are merciful and compassionate, you have
probably been kissed by God's righteousness and peace. Another word
for "kissed" might be "blessed." Both words reflect an EXTREMELY
LOVING God who wants to give you His best. Do you feel loved today?
YOU ARE!
