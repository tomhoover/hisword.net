_Genesis 28:15a  
And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places ,
whither thou goest..._

Are you going some place special today? We can take for granted the
smallest of blessings that we traffic in every day. It is an awesome
thing that God promised previous generations, and promises us today,
that He will go with us every place we go. The question is, do you
take Him with you, every place you go? Be mindful of God&rsquo;s
presence and protection in your life today.
