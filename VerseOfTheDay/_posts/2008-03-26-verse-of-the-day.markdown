_Romans 8:31-32  
31 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can
be against us?  
32 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,
how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?_

It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many things are against you, if you
have God, that&rsquo;s all that matters. Life is most profitable when
you focus on God&rsquo;s blessings and promises, instead of problems.
God&rsquo;s for you!
