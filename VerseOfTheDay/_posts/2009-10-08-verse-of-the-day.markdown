title: October 8th - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_Psalm 37:7  
Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself
because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who
bringeth wicked devices to pass._

It may look like the wicked are prospering and winning the victory,
but be assured that is not the case. You can REST in the LORD today,
because He has promised that He has everything under control! The
righteous will have the last word, but until then, we must patiently
wait! REST in your LORD!
