_Ephesians 6:10  
Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His
might._

It's only the second day of 2009, but you will be challenged today
to keep the commitments that you have made for the new year. If you
are sincerely committed to change, you must daily connect yourself
with God. You are not able to do this by yourself. Stop and ask God
to powerfully strengthen your resolve for His honor and glory.
