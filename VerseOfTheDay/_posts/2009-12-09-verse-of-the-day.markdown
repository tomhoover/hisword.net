title: December 9th - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_Proverbs 3:31  
Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways._

Sometimes our thinkin' can be stinkin'! We can think that wealth
equals happiness. We can think that if we don't have certain
possessions, we can't be happy. We can think that people who have
money, don't have any problems. We can think that way, but the Bible
says, it's not that way! In fact, we are told that if you have a
personal relationship with Jesus Christ, you possess the world's most
valuable commodity. Check your thinkin'! You are rich, if you have
JESUS!
