title: May 16th - Partnership with God in Attitude and Mind-Set
---

_Deuteronomy 12:18b  
And thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God in all that thou
puttest thine hands unto._

Life is too short to waste even one day being down and discouraged.
Ask God to give you a mind-set, that no matter what you do today, you
will do it with joy in your heart. You can have joy in even the small
things, if you will purpose to do so. Some day in eternity, you will
realize that the small things, like a joyful spirit, were really the
big things in God's eyes.
