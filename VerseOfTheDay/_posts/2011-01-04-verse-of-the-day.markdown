_Proverbs 30:5  
Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their
trust in him._

There is an expression in the finance world that says, "His advice
is 'pure gold!'" That pretty much sums up God's WORDS! They are solid
and trustworthy. To the depressed, they become hope. To the burden
bearer, they become freedom. To the lonely, they become the One and
Only constant friend. God has a WORD for you today...listen to His
voice and trust Him! FAITH-BOOK!
