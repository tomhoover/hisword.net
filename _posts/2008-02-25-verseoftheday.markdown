_Psalm 3:3  
But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up
of mine head._

Just think about all the wonderful things that God has done for
you. He shields you from Satan and his sinful temptations. He sends
blessings your way to lift your head when things look hopeless. WOW,
you are so blessed! Show your thanks to God, by /touching someone's
life/ today and sharing what God has done for you.
