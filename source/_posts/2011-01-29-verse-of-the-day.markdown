_II Timothy 3:15  
And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are
able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ
Jesus._

The children of this world represent the next generation. If they
are to have the wisdom of God in their lives, they must be given the
WORDS of God that will bring them to FAITH in Jesus Christ. Every one
of us have a great responsibility to share God's WORD with them.
Parents, make a point to share at least one verse of Scripture with
your children every day. Grandparents and older Christians, share
God's WORD with someone younger. Don't live your life selfishly,
invest in the future!
