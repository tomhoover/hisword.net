title: February 5th - Partnership with God in Loving Relationships

_Romans 14:13  
Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this
rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in
his brother's way._

Whether we like it or not, we are all called to make judgments
about situations every day. When it comes to "judging other people,"
we are admonished to be careful, as only God can see a heart.
Whenever you find yourself wanting to judge someone, instead of
judging, say a prayer for them, and leave the judging to your
Partner.
