_Matthew 4:16  
The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which
sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up._

Imagine being lost deep in a cave, in total darkness for years. It
would be maddening. Then imagine a bright light bursting forth in the
distance, growing ever brighter as you make your way closer to it! The
excitement and hope that would flood your soul would be indescribable.
I remember seeing and coming to the light of Christ through the cave
of religious darkness and ignorance. I am overwhelmed that God gave
me the ability to chose to turn to the light and not away from it.
