_Jeremiah 31:3  
The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved
thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I
drawn thee._

How great is our God! The Lord God, Creator of heaven and earth,
has faithfully loved and cared for every generation of His children
since Adam and Eve. Just as He walked in the garden and demonstrated
love and kindness to them, He has that same love and kindness for you
as you walk through this life. There is nothing better than that sweet
fellowship time when you talk with your God. Celebrate a loving GOD,
who cares about YOU!
