_Psalm 103:11  
For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy
toward them that fear him._

In other words, it is infinite, unfathomable, and magnificent, and
thousands of other adjectives that you could think of. God's mercy
has taken me from a false religion to, not only the free gift of
salvation in Christ by the grace of God, but to a knowledge of His
truth and His will through His Spirit through His Word. The Mercy of
God is amazing.
