_Deuteronomy 6:4-6  
Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: And thou shalt love
the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day,
shall be in thine heart._

Do you believe in God's providence? You have been given a verse
today in God's providence. God is asking you to LOVE Him through your
words and actions. He is asking for your heart, your soul, your
strength to be used to glorify Him. To do this, you will have to lay
aside your self-focused plans, and be open to His Spirit's leading.
Hear, O Christian: Love your GOD with all your heart!
