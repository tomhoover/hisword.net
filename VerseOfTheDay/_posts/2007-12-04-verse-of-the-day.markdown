_Ephesians 1:3  
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath
blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in
Christ._

Has God blessed you this past year? Is there really anything you
absolutely need besides Jesus? Reflecting on your blessings, will
give you a smile and will help you shorten your own personal
Christmas list.
