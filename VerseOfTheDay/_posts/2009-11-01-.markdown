title: November 1st - Extreme Love...Is Kind
---

_I Corinthians 13:4b  
Charity suffereth long, and is kind..._

Most of the time, you will be kind and considerate to people who
treat you right. Today you are challenged to smile in the face of
unjust treatment. You can find encouragement to be kind when you look
at the Savior's example of EXTREME LOVE on the cross. He died for
those who spit upon Him, as well as those who worshiped at His feet.
/They will know you are like Jesus by the kindness you show to
undeserving people!/
