_Romans 8:31  
What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be
against us?_

The verse for today, challenges you to believe that God is in your
corner. What are you going to say to that? If God is for you, and
believes in you, what does it matter what others think? You can let
go of a lot of stuff when you know God is for you. Believe the best
and let go of the rest! Smile!
