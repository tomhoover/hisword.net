_Romans 8:24-25  
For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for
what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that
we see not, then do we with patience wait for it._

FAITH and HOPE are passionate cousins of inspiration. Both are
qualified, by believing in things that you cannot see. Who can see
the force that holds this world together? This power must be defined
through FAITH and HOPE in Jesus Christ! This brings excitement,
adventure, and purpose to this life. This same FAITH and HOPE
inspires you to live above the cares and concerns of this depraved
world. They keep you going as you wait patiently for heaven&rsquo;s
rewards.
