title: June 12th - God&rsquo;s Place of Peace
---

_Ephesians 1:2  
Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
Christ._

Peace to you, friend! Do you greet people every day? In the
sixties, people often made a &ldquo;peace&rdquo; sign when they were
greeting one another. If you speak to people and greet them today,
you are giving them a &ldquo;peace sign&rdquo;, by just showing
consideration and respect. You could make a difference in
someone&rsquo;s life today! Speak up!
