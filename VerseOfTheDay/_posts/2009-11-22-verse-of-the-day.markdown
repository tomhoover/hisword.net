_Psalm 36:10  
O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy
righteousness to the upright in heart._

Don't stop now...continue loving the difficult people and continue
doing deeds of kindness for those undeserving people. This isn't
something that we are to do on days we feel like it. This should be a
part of your life every day. Ask God to lay someone on your heart,
with whom you could show His love and kindness today!
