title: December 29th - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_Isaiah 35:10  
And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with
songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and
gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away._

What is this "everlasting joy upon your head?" In Bible days,
people covered their heads as a means of protection from the elements
(sun, wind, rain) around them. Christians are protected from the
elements (sin) of the world, when they put on the helmet of
salvation. Joy is the expression of your heart for the eternal change
that salvation makes in your life. Wear your everlasting joy today,
and sorrow and sighing shall flee away!
