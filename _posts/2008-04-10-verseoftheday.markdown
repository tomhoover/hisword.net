_Jeremiah 33:3  
Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty
things, which thou knowest not._

God not only wants to talk to you today, He wants to do great and
mighty things for you. It all begins with a call. When was the last
time you called your heavenly Father? He&rsquo;s got a direct line,
with no need for call waiting.
