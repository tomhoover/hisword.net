_Psalm 42:8  
Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the daytime, and in
the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my
life._

The Psalmist expected his deliverance to come from God's loving
kindness. Things are bad, but they shall not always be so. God is
good all the time as indicated by the "daytime" and "night" mentioned
in the verse. In the midst of perilous times, he knew that he had a
life, and more importantly, he had a God who ruled over that life
giving every difficulty and disappointment divine purpose.
