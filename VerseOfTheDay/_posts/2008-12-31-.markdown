title: December 31st - Partnership with God in Personal Finances
---

_Philippians 3:13-14  
13 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one
thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching
forth unto those things which are before,  
14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God
in Christ Jesus._

Tomorrow is the beginning of a new year. You might not have done
the best job with things this past year, but you are told to put that
behind you. Every day is a new beginning with the Lord. Ask God for
wisdom in your finances, and for the discipline to do a better job
for His honor and glory in 2009.
