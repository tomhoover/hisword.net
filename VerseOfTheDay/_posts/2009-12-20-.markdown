_Psalm 111:1  
Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in
the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation._

"Our entire being is fashioned as an instrument of praise. Just as
a master violin maker designs an instrument to produce maximum
aesthetic results, so God tailor made our bodies, souls, and spirits,
to work together in consonance to produce pleasing expressions of
praise and worship. When we use body language to express praise, that
which is internal, becomes visible." - Lamar Boschman
"The song in a Christian's heart can be seen in his countenance." -
Clinta June Campbell, beloved wife of Pastor Raleigh Campbell.
