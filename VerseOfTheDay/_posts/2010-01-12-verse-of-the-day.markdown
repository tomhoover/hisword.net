title: January 12th - Extreme Love...Is not proud or self-focused
---

_Philippians 2:13  
For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his
good pleasure._

Just in case you've forgotten, your verse today reminds you that
anything good in you is because of God. That can be a very
encouraging statement as well as a reprimand. The fact that God is so
involved in your life, takes the weight off your shoulders, if you
will submit to Him. Someone said, "The weaker you are, the stronger
God can become!" Humble your heart and seek God's face.
