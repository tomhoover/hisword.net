_Psalm 51:6  
Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden
part thou shalt make me to know wisdom._

The very thing that God desires in us, He works in us. God desires
to see truth lived out in our lives through FAITH. Don't worry, you
aren't alone in such an awesome assignment. Stop and ask God to help
you APPLY FAITH to your speech, actions, and decisions throughout
this beautiful day! Every day is beautiful when you focus on GOD!
