_Psalm 139:17  
How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the
sum of them!_

This verse reminds us that we were created for God. God is thinking
about you, whether you are thinking about Him or not. He is daily
putting things in front of you that will remind you that He loves and
cares about you.
