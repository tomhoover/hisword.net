title: June 10th - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith
---

_Hebrews 11:1  
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen._

Another way of saying that is, "Faith is putting all your eggs in
God's basket, then counting your blessings before they hatch." -
Ramona Carroll That's why FAITH is such an adventure. You just never
can imagine all the wonderful ways that God is going to bless and
care for you today! Get excited, it's going to be a great day! FAITH
is giving God a blank check to direct your life!
