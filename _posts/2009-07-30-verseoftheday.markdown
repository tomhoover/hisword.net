title: July 30th - Partnership with God in Sacrifice
---

_Psalm 39:1  
I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue:
I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me._

When you are faced with injustice, you might really want to defend
yourself and speak your mind. God calls you to sacrifice your voice,
and let Him defend you instead. Pray and ask God to help you speak in
the right way, at the right time today.
