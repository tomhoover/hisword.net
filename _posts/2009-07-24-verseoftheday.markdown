title: July 24th - Partnership with God in Sacrifice
---

_Romans 8:17  
And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and join-heirs with
Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also
glorified together._

As a Christian, you will never suffer alone. Just as we will one
day share in the glories of heaven, today Christ promises to be with
you in everything that you face upon this earth. Get happy! It only
gets better!
