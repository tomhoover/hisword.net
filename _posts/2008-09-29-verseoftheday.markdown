title: September 29th - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Psalm 103:12  
As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our
transgressions from us._

From New York City, New York to Los Angeles, California, that's a
small picture of the distance that your sins are separated from you,
if you have asked God's forgiveness. If God can put that much
distance between you and your sins, why can't you put them behind you
and forget them?
