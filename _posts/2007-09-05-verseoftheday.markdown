_Psalm 55:22  
Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall
never suffer the righteous to be moved._

With Jesus as your foundation, your needs will be met and you will
be immoveable, never moved from God&rsquo;s favor, even in
chastisement. Jesus said, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His
righteousness, and all THESE THINGS (needs) shall be added unto you."
Peter probably had this Psalm in mind when he said, "Casting all your
care upon him; for he careth for you."
