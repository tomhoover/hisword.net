_II Peter 3:18  
But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen._

This is the last verse in the books that the Holy Spirit used Peter
to pen. Usually when you are ending a letter, you reiterate the burden
of your heart one more time for emphasis. God wants to remind us one
more time about what's really important! Many of you will be content
with mediocrity- the bare minimum. Many of you will be too busy
filling your time with the things that bring personal pleasure and
fun. Many of you will have powerless Christian testimonies. But those
who are ADDING and growing in their FAITH, will get God's best. They
will live and know real excitement in life! Is your FAITH growing or
minimal?
