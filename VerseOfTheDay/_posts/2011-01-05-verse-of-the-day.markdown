_Psalm 119:97  
O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day._

There are so many distractions in this busy, fast-paced world we
live in. You have to think that there is some kind of a plan to keep
you from thinking upon God's WORDS. Why? Because you receive power
and strength from just meditating upon God's WORDS! Sounds like you
need to purpose to meditate upon God's WORDS today!
