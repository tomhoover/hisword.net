title: December 5th - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_Ephesians 5:3  
But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be
once named among you, as becometh saints._

Only twenty days till Christmas, and you've probably got a lot to
do during this busy time of the year. Don't forget to ask God to help
you keep a good testimony as you are out and about. Remember, it's not
about getting, but giving. It's not about acquiring worldly
possessions, but possessing the Lord Jesus Christ in your heart. Be
mindful to share that gift with those you meet today.
