title: March 31st - Partnership with God to Touch Lives
---

_Acts 26:22a  
Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day,
witnessing both to small and great._

Albert Einstein said, /"Only a life lived for others is a life
worthwhile."/ If you want to really make your life count for Christ,
look upon every face you see today as someone in need of a Savior.
Pray for God's power to help you see people differently today, and
for God's boldness to be a witness.
