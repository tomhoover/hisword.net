title: September 15th - Partnership with God in the Church
---

_Romans 12:4  
For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not
the same office._

Everybody's got a job to do in the church. You may not have found
yours yet, but there is something that God wants you to do. The
pastor of the church carries a heavy load, encourage him, and offer
to do the job no one else wants to do. When you share the load, many
members become one body.
