_Romans 13:12  
The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast
off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light._

What is the "armor of light?" This armor is a tool or weapon to be
used offensively for a purpose, not defensively for protection. It is
a different word for "armor" than is used on Ephesians 6. In context
here, we are encouraged to use the light of Christ that dwells in us
by faith as a tool to illuminate those in our world to the Light and
Life that is only in Christ.
