title: January 11th - God's Place of Power
---

_Psalm 9:7  
But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for
judgment._

You can start your day with the peace of knowing that God is
eternal, and if you have given your heart to Him, you will also live
for eternity. That truth should put a different spin on your day.
