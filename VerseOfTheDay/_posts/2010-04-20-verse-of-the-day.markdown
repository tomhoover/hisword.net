_James 1:20  
For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God._

All of us get upset with situations and relationships from time to
time, and if you are impulsive, you can do the wrong thing.
Disciplined Christians submit their emotions to God's wisdom. You
should act upon what you believe, rather than react to what you feel.
The commandments were summed up in two: Love God with all your heart,
and love your neighbor as yourself. Obey God, not your emotions.
