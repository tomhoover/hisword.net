title: August 3rd - Extreme Love...hopes and believes the best.
---

_Romans 15:13  
Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost._

You are what you eat!! Spiritually, you become what you fill your
life with. If you are filling your life with God's Words of power and
HOPE, you will have joy and peace. On the other hand, if you are
filling your life with possessions and self-indulgence, HOPE becomes
conditional. To be healthy spiritually, you need a daily dose of
God's Word. What are you filling your time with? HOPE grows when you
are filled with Jesus Christ!
