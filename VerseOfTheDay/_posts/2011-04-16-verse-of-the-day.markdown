_Romans 8:38-39  
For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,
Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
Lord._

This is absolutely one of the most POWERFUL verses in the Bible!
It's an "assurance-insurance" verse. If you have given your heart to
Jesus, there is nothing that can separate you from the love of GOD!
Have you caught the attitude in this verse? Paul was persuaded! By
FAITH he believed that God's love secured him, in even the most
difficult situation. Take a moment to thank God for His amazing love,
and then go out and tell a lost of world that JESUS LOVES THEM!
