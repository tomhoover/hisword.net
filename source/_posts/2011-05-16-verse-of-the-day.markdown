_Psalm 101:6  
Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may
dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me._

Don't worry, this verse isn't saying that you have to be perfect to
serve God! Whew! That's a relief, because no one could serve Him if
that were the case. Instead, it says that God is SEARCHing the world
over for hearts that are growing and maturing in FAITH. He will
reward the FAITH FULL! Are you FULL of FAITH? Every day can be a new
beginning with GOD!
