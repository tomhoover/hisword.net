_II Corinthians 6:16  
And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the
temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and
walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people._

God calls you to be spiritually alert and aware of sin&rsquo;s
temptations at all times. You shouldn't be going any place without
the knowledge of His presence being with you. WWJD? Let Jesus guide
your path.
