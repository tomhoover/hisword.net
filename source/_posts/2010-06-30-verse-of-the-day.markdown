_Psalm 100:5  
For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
endureth to all generations._

There have been countless generations before you upon this earth.
The TRUTH hasn't changed through these many years because of a loving
and merciful God. However, the TRUTH has changed many lives! What kind
of person would we be to keep good news, the gospel of TRUTH, from
someone who could be delivered from bondage? LORD, remind us today,
to share your TRUTH with others who need to hear it!
