_I Thessalonians 5:24  
Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it._

It's comforting to know that you are not alone in your struggle to
faithfully live the Christian life. God doesn't ask anything of you
that He will not help you to accomplish. Throughout time, God has
been faithful to keep all the promises He has made to strengthen and
care for His children. Although you may not see it with your eyes,
God is faithfully at work in the world, caring for you!
