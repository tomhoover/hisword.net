_Luke 16:10  
He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much:
and he that is unjust in the least, is unjust also in much._

At this busy time of the year, you are going to be tempted to spend
less time with God. Be reminded that time spent with God may seem like
a small thing, but it reaps BIG dividends and could save you from a
multitude of sinful purchases.
