_I Peter 3:15  
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to
give an answer to every man that asketh you of the reason of the hope
that is in you with meekness and fear._

There will never be a day when there are not needs in the lives of
people you know. These people are looking for answers to their
questions about life. Ask God to use your actions and speech today,
in a way that will speak faith and hope for the searching hearts that
touch your life. Then be ready to speak up for the Lord.
