_II Corinthians 5:9  
Wherefore we labor, that, whether present or absent, we may be
accepted of him._

HAPPY LABOR DAY! Most people are given this day off, as a time to
rest from physical labor. Resting is fine, but there is never a time
when you should quit serving the Lord! The enemy's voice constantly
tries to convince Christians, through lies, to do just that. If you
feel yourself wavering, call upon the Lord and ask Him to strengthen
your resolve. It will be worth it all one day, but until then,
ENDURE!
