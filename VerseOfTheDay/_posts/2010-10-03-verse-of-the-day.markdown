_Hebrews 11:3  
Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word
of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which
do appear._

Who can make something out of nothing? Mankind just thinks they can
create beauty! All the most beautiful art forms in this world were
made with raw materials. Where did the soil, plants, and minerals
come from? If you believe the Bible, you know that they were spoken
into existence by God. Can you imagine the "power of His words?"
Mountains, large bodies of water, and the most intricate miniature
flower responded alike to the vibrations of His voice. The mighty
Creator is still speaking. He finds you in the dark moments of life
and gently comforts you with His love. God still confirms your FAITH,
if you chose to see Him!
