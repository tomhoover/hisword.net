_Philippians 4:9  
Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard,
and seen in me, do; and the God of peace shall be with you._

As you start your day, think of one attribute of Jesus Christ that
you most admire in Him. It could be His compassion, courage,
patience, or humility, to name only a few. Ask God to help you have
(the attribute you choose), as you go through the day. When you try
to be like our example, Jesus Christ, the God of peace shall be with
you.
