_James 4:17  
Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him
it is sin._

You might find yourself choosing between the inconvenience of doing
good and keeping your commitment, or being a bit lazy and ignoring it
today. Jim Rohn put it best in the following words: /"We must all
suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of
regret. The difference is, discipline weighs ounces, while regret
weighs tons."/
