_Psalm 9:1  
I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart; I will shew forth
all thy marvelous works._

This is the day! This is the day when you need to tell everyone
about the marvelous things that God has done for you. Do you need
some help thinking of things? Can you name ten things? That&rsquo;s a
small list compared to what God has prepared for you throughout
eternity. Smile and enjoy being a Christian today!
