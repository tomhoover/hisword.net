_Luke 6:38  
Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down,
and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your
bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be
measured to you again._

Do you really believe what our verse says? It's true, whether you
believe it and live it out, or not. You can't out give God. Someone
said, "No one has ever become poor by giving." Instead the opposite
is true, we become poor, when we stop giving. If you find yourself
poor and needy, it could be you need to be a better "giver." If you
are person who "gives more than you take," be encouraged and keep
giving!
