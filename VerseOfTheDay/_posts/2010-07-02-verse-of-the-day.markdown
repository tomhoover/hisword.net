_Galatians 6:2  
Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ._

It has been said that we too often underestimate the power of a
touch, a smile, a kind word, an honest compliment, or the smallest
act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.
On any given day, every person who comes into your life is carrying
some kind of burden. Everyone needs to have God's love demonstrated
to them. Will you "lighten" the load, and encourage those God brings
into your life today?
