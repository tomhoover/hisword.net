title: October 21st - God's Place of Priority
---

_Hebrews 10:25  
Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of
some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see
the day approaching._

Be faithful to God's place (house of worship) and encourage someone
else to do the same.
