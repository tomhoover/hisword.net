_Isaiah 40:29  
He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he
increaseth strength._

You can be too proud for God to help you, but you can't be too
weak. When you admit your need of God's help, you are opening the
door to power and strength. Often Christians will open that door for
the LORD to help them, but before long, when things are going better,
their pride (self reliance) shuts the door. The wide open door is a
picture of a trusting relationship with God, through which His power
can flow. Ask God to help you keep the door of your heart open to His
guidance.
