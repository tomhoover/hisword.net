title: July 22nd - God&rsquo;s Place of Salvation
---

_Luke 15:7  
I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner
that repenteth, more than over the ninety and nine just persons, which
need no repentance._

Heaven rejoices every time a sinner gives their heart to Jesus. Can
you imagine the roar of praise, when all the heavenly hosts unite
their voices? Share God&rsquo;s &ldquo;good news&rdquo; with someone
today, and listen carefully, you might just hear a shout!
