_Ephesians 6:18  
Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and
watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all
saints._

/"Eighteen-year-old Hudson Taylor wandered into his father's
library and read a gospel tract. He couldn't shake off its message.
Finally, falling to his knees, he accepted Christ as his Savior.
Later, his mother, who had been away, returned home. When Hudson told
her the good news, she said, 'I already know. Ten days ago, the very
date on which you tell me you read that tract, I spent the entire
afternoon in prayer for you until the Lord assured me that my wayward
son had been brought into the fold.' "/ &ndash; Our Daily Bread, July
19, 1989
Is there someone in your life you need to pray for today?
