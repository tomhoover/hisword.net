_Psalm 119:2  
Blessed are they that keep His testimonies, and that seek Him with
the whole heart._

You can find it hard to keep your new year's commitments if it
isn&rsquo;t something that you want to do with your whole heart. If
you are doing something because of peer pressure, it won't last past
January. On the other hand, if you are doing it for God and with your
whole heart, you are going to be surprised at what God can do through
you.
