_II Corinthians 5:14-15  
14 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge,
that if one died for all, then were all dead:  
15 And that he died for all, that they which live should not
henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them,
and rose again._

Verse 14 is a very interesting verse because "constraineth" is a
very interesting verb. It literally means to press the ears together,
more generally, to hold together, and it comes from the same root as
the word used in Col. 1:17 which states, that Jesus Christ holds the
creation together ("by Him all things consist" or are held together).
So here Paul's conception of Christ's love for him holds him together
to his task whatever men think or say, and His love should and can do
the same for us.
