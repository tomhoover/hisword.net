_Galatians 6:9  
And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall
reap, if we faint not._

This is not a good day to be down or discouraged! This could be the
day you reap all those wonderful blessings that God has promised to
those who are faithful to Him! You wouldn't want to miss that! Put on
that smile! It's going to be a good day after all!
