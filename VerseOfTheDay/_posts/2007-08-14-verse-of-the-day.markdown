_Psalm 103:8-10  
8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in
mercy.  
9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.  
10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
according to our iniquities._

"Plenteous" is a word that we don&rsquo;t use much anymore. We
would probably say "abundant." God has an abundant supply of mercy,
and I know this not only from the Scriptures, but from its liberal
application in my life. As I read this, I wondered why God is so
plenteous in mercy, yet many of those who claim to know God in Christ
seem so chintzy when it comes to being merciful. Let us remember to be
merciful and long-suffering to others as God is to us. Jesus said,
"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."
