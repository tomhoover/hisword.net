_Psalm 25:5  
Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my
salvation; on thee do I wait all the day._

Has the Holy Spirit been talking to you lately about something? The
Holy Spirit is that small quiet voice inside you that leads you and
teaches you, after you have given your heart to Jesus Christ. When
you are reading your Bible, He helps you understand and personalize
what you read. He challenges you to do the right things. He wants to
be an open voice in your life. Listen for God's voice and embrace it
today!
