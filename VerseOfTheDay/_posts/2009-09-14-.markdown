title: September 14th - Partnership with God in the Church
---

_Revelation 3:13  
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches._

If God wrote a letter to your church, what do you think it would
say? What would God say about your involvement and attitudes? Take a
minute to ask your Partner to show you what you could do to impact
your church.
