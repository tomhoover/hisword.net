_Psalm 122:1  
I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the
Lord._

It's like the first bite of a warm chocolate cake. It's like a cool
breeze coming out of nowhere on a hot day. It's like a walk in a
beautiful garden of sweet-smelling roses. It's the like the best
things in this life. Going to God's house should be one of the best
things in your life, as your soul is fed and your spirits are brought
to life in His presence.
