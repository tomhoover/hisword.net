_Hebrews 11:30  
By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed
about seven days._

Notice the walls didn't fall down until they had marched around
them seven days. We can only imagine the thoughts of the people when
they started marching. They had never fought a battle this way! Would
someone try to kill them as they were visibly marching? How could they
possibly get over those tall walls? Somewhere along the way, FAITH
conquered their thoughts! Could it be that your thoughts are like
some of their thoughts? FAITH in GOD is still powerful enough to
bring down the strong holds in your life!
