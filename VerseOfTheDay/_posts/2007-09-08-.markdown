_Philippians 4:13  
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me._

"Strengtheneth me" is a causative verb meaning to empower, to pour
power into one. Paul has such strength so long as Jesus keeps on
putting power (dunamis=dynamite) into him. Christ in us, is like
spinach to Popeye. The spinach only empowered Popeye over Brutus when
he allowed it to be poured into him. By faith and surrender of our
will to Christ&rsquo;s we can indeed do or endure all things through
Him.
