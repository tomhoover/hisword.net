_Jeremiah 33:3  
Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty
things, which thou knowest not._

Why is it on one day, you have this huge FAITH for this huge
problem in your life, and the next day, when just a small
discouragement hits you, you are overcome with worry and fear? We are
reminded in our verse that we need to cover EVERY day with prayer!
Might and power to live the Christian life, are directly connected to
GOD! Connect your FAITH to the power source through prayer every day!
It will make a difference!
