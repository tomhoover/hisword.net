title: April 28th - Partnership with God for a Victorious Life
---

_Psalm 56:3  
What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee._

If your focus is on how you might fail or on the negative things in
life, you are not living a victorious life. You can't be negative or
fearful and win the victory. God wants you to give your life to Him
and trust Him. Nothing is going to happen to you until God is through
with you here on this earth. God has you in His protective hands, so
trust Him!
