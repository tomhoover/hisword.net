_II Chronicles 7:14  
If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves,
and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then
will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal
their land._

Take time to pray today for your nation and its leaders. Your
prayers do make a difference, as God often uses one humble
person&rsquo;s prayer to part the waters for a nation.
