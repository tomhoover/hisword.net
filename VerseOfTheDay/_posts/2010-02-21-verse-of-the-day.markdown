_Psalm 119:171  
My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes._

We learn how to sing the music of heaven (praise), when we see the
blessings that come from obeying God's rules for holy living. It
could be that you are sad today and don't have any music in your
heart. Stop and make a list of all the blessings you have as a result
of obedience to God's Word. It won't be long till you will have found
your song again. Praise your God. He's leaning over listening for
YOUR voice.
