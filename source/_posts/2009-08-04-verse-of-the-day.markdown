_Psalm 52:8b  
...I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever._

Throughout his life, David had times when he had trouble trusting
God, but he always came to the same conclusion: God is merciful
forever! God will always be there to help you get through the trials
and changes that you face every day. Take a minute to praise God for
His mercy in your life.
