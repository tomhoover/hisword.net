_Psalm 12:6  
The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace
of earth, purified seven times._

WORDS, WORDS, WORDS! You will hear thousands of WORDS spoken in the
span of this day. Only God's WORDS will be spoken to you without
error. They are pure in motive and truth. They bring life and pure
hope. They are spoken in pure love. They are intended to purify your
FAITH! God's WORDS can make the difference in your day, if you are
listening to Him!
