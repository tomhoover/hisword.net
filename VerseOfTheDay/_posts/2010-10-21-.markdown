_II Corinthians 5:7  
For we walk by faith, not by sight._

If you are the cautious type, FAITH can be a huge challenge. You
can be fearful and see a "snake" in every closet! Personalities and
human characteristics can often limit our FAITH. If you find yourself
worrying and fearful all the time, you need God's help to change. This
is where you must ask God to "re-wire" your thinking process. FAITH is
not only believing that God can, it's knowing that He will! Ask God to
strengthen your FAITH!
