_I Corinthians 2:9  
But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath
prepared for them that love him._

The eye, ear, and heart of man&rsquo;s flesh has no earthly idea as
to the blessings of God to His children in Jesus Christ. The eye, ear,
and heart of the child of God's spirit, through the telescope of
faith, can see a glimpse of the blessings of God, but whatever you
see or imagine, know that God's prepared blessings for His children
that love Him will be infinitely more magnificent than your present
mind's eye can perceive.
