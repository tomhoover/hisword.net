title: June 12th - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith
---

_Isaiah 43:2  
When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest
through the fire, thou shall not be burned; neither shall the flame
kindle upon thee._

When you are going through a difficult time, God will be with you.
When the problems become seemingly unsurmountable, God will still be
with you. When the fiery words of bitterness and rejection break your
heart, God will not let it consume you, if you remember He's with you.
Nothing can get at you when your FAITH is secure in God Almighty. That
should put a smile on your face!
