title: September 1st - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Nehemiah 9:17  
And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou
didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion
appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God
ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and of great
kindness, and forsookest them not._

You are foolish if you plan to sin and later plan to ask God's
forgiveness. God is long-suffering and forgiving, but you will reap
sin's consequences. Every day can be a new beginning for the child of
God. Confess your besetting sin to God and ask for His power to help
you change! Genuine change comes through the power of the cross and
Jesus Christ.
