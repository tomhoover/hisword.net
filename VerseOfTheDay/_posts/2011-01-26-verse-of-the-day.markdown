_Proverbs 1:5  
A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of
understanding shall attain unto wise counsels._

The Bible, God's BOOK, is the greatest source of wisdom upon this
earth. Then why don't people read it more? It could be that they are
just too busy to search out God's wisdom, or it could be that they
don't want to do what it instructs. No matter, the loser is the
person who won't access the resources given to him. Do you need
wisdom? God's given you a manual. USE IT!
