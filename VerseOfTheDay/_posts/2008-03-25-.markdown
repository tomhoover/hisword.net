title: March 25th - God&rsquo;s Place of Promise
---

_Romans 5:10  
For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death
of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his
life._

&ldquo;_________ is the best thing that ever happened to me.&rdquo;
How would you fill in the blank? If you were condemned to die without
any hope and someone took your place, that would be the best thing
ever. Thank you, Jesus!
