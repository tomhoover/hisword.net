_Galatians 3:16  
Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not,
And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is
Christ._

God has kept every promise He has made concerning Israel. Think
about this as you are choosing a presidential candidate. Pray for
your nation today.
