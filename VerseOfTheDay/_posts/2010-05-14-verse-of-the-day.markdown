title: May 14th - Extreme Love...forgives and forgets offenses.
---

_II Corinthians 2:10-11  
To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any
thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the
person of Christ; Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we
are not ignorant of his devices._

We are reminded that Satan knows our weakness and knows the way to
pull us away from a righteous walk with the LORD. He often uses
thoughts like: "Go ahead, do what you want, you won't get in any
trouble! God doesn't exist!" so you will rationalize sinning. In the
verses before this, Christ declares His existence and that it was
LOVE that motivated Him to forgive sin. He tells believers to think
right, and not listen to the Evil One. EXTREME LOVE shouts,
"Forgive!"
