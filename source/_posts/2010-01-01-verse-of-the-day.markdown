_I Corinthians 13:4d  
...charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up._

On this first day of this new year, you are presented with a
challenge. Our verse says that real love focuses upon others and not
self. Another way of saying that is, "Life isn't just about you and
how everything relates to you." EXTREME LOVE asks, "Are YOU
comfortable?" focusing on the needs of others before self. This is
not a natural response, therefore you must be purposed and have God's
help to meet this challenge. Will you pray, purpose, and practice to
think of others first in 2010?
