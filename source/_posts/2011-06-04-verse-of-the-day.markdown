_Psalm 86:11  
Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart
to fear thy name._

"For a man to walk in pride, is something more than to be proud: it
says, that pride is his way, his element; that he is wholly under the
influence of it.&rdquo; --William Jay.
Nobody likes to admit they are prideful. Pride starts off as being a
motivator for a good work ethic, and before you know it, it becomes a
source of emotional stimulus. Often we are blinded to our pride, but
pride shows itself in the person who thinks they know it all. God
humbled David on several occasions, and he declares that he
continually needed to be taught God's truth, and needed God's help to
live! Do you see yourself needing God? He wants to teach you as you
walk through life today!
