_Romans 9:1  
I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me
witness in the Holy Ghost._

Winston Churchill said, /"A lie gets half way around the world
before the truth has time to get it's pants on."/ That's a sad
commentary on our world, but lies are commonplace with the TRUTH
standing out as an exception in most lives. May you be that exception
today. The greatest thing you can do in honor of TRUTH is to live it
out in your life. The TRUTH will still be standing, when the lies
have all died out!
