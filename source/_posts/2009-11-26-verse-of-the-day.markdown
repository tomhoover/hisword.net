_Psalm 63:3-4  
Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise
thee. Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in
thy name._

The most elaborate display of love on this earth cannot compare
with being able to share eternal life with God, in whom love is
defined. Thinking of that future day when you will see LOVE for
yourself, you must lift up your hands and praise Him!!
My life is in You Lord, and I praise YOU!
