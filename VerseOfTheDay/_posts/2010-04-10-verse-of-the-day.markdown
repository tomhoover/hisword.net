_Ecclesiastes 7:9  
Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the
bosom of fools._

Part of "growing" in your Christian life, has to do with knowing
your "weaknesses." If you find yourself getting upset all the time
with others, it could be you have the problem, not others. Extreme
Love is not easily provoked, or upset. When those thoughts of anger
and resentment come to your mind, quickly cast them down and pray for
God's deliverance. Wise people give anger the boot!
