_Psalm 31:23  
O love the Lord, all ye his saints; for the Lord preserveth the
faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer._

It is only natural that if you love the Lord and have profited from
your relationship with Him, that you would desire for others to know
and love the Lord also. That is why out of the abundance of our
hearts, we share the "good news" of the gospel with others. God gives
life or judgment, according to those who put their trust in Him.
Someone you are going to come in contact with today, needs to know
that "God loves them!" When you love the Lord, you will want to share
His gospel with others.
