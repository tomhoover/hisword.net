_Isaiah 9:6-7  
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called
Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The
Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there
shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to
order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from
henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform
this._

Can you hear the music that goes with these words? For the child of
God, the music of the heart reaches a great crescendo as we read the
words, "henceforth even forever!" The eternal God gave us His Son, as
He said, and one day we will be a part of His final symphony. We will
sing with joyful, overflowing hearts of gratitude, "Worthy is the
Lamb!" He is Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting
Father, and The Prince of Peace! Sing it with all your heart!
