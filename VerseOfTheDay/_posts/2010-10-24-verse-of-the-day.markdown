_Romans 3:28  
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the
deeds of the law._

Someone said, "Faith isn't Faith until it's all you are holding on
to." The primary thing that God wants to see in the life of every
Christian is FAITH! The tendency of most is to "hold on" to the
option of trying to work things out on our own before we bother God.
This isn't God's order. God wants to see FAITH as your first option.
Ask God to help you think, speak, and live out FAITH first, in every
part of your life today! FAITH FULL!
