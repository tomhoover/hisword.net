_John 17:15  
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that
thou shouldest keep them from the evil._

God has positioned you in your particular place in this world with
purpose. As a believer, He wants you to live a victorious life before
a watching world. Be what you are supposed to be! Don't be afraid to
reach out and share with others, as God has you covered!
