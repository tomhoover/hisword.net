_Psalm 92:13  
Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the
courts of our God._

If you don't like serving the Lord in His church now, then don't go
to heaven, because that's what you'll be doing in heaven one day. Oh,
that we could all enjoy serving the Lord and bring honor to His name
today! Think about it!
