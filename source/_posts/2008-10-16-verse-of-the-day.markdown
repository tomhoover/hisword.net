_I Corinthians 10:31  
Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to
the glory of God._

It's good to plan your day as best as you can before it starts, if
you want to get some meaningful things accomplished. Don't be so tied
to your plans that you resent the appointments that God has arranged
for you today. Remember your agreement to make the Boss look good
today.
