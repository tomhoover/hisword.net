_Luke 1:37  
For with God nothing shall be impossible._

Most often it will be unbelievers who will say, "Happy Holidays!"
Many don't think it was possible that God could send His Son to be
born of a virgin on earth. The only miracle that many will believe in
is a changed life. Wherever you go today, act like a Christian and
don't just say "Merry Christmas," instead say, "Jesus Is My Reason
for the Season!"
