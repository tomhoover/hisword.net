title: December 29th - Partnership with God in Personal Finances

_Philippians 4:11  
Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in
whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content._

Contentment is not something found in Oklahoma, Texas, or New York.
It doesn't come with a location or with earthly possessions. Most
often, contentment is something that we must work at and learn. With
God as your partner, you are over half way there.
