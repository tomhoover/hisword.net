_Isaiah 41:10  
Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy
God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will
uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness._

The world parches and hardens our souls. It is when we are in God's
presence that we find refreshment and restoration. He calms our fears
and strengthens our heart. You cannot survive long without a drink
from the life giving pool of God's lovingkindness. Don't live your
life in fear, God promises a better way!
