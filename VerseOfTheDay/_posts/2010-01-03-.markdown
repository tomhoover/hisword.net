title: January 3rd - Extreme Love...Is not proud or self-focused
---

_Galatians 5:14  
For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt
love thy neighbor as thyself._

Make this "one word," "LOVE," your personal theme for today. Before
you speak, before you make a decision, before you go anywhere, examine
your action in light of LOVE! Is this a loving thing to say? Is it
loving to include the outcast? How can I show love to that person who
doesn't yet know Christ? If you will make an effort to think about
loving people, you will have a wonderful day, because "love never
fails!"
