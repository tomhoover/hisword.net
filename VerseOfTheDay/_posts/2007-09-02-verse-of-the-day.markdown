_Psalm 118:21-22  
21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my
salvation.  
22 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of
the corner._

In raising Christ from the dead, God exalted Him to be the Head of
the church that He had established, the very pinnacle of her glory
and beauty. Since then He has become the confidence of the Gentiles,
and thus He has joined the two walls of Jew and Gentile into one
stately temple, and is seen to be the binding corner-stone, making
both one in the Body of Christ, the Lord&rsquo;s Church. Serve the
Lord in a sound church, a body of Christ, an institution of God's
truth.
