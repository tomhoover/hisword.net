_Hebrews 11:17  
By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that
had received the promises offered up his only begotten son._

Every generation upon this earth has had their FAITH tried. Abraham
was willing to give his son's life, if necessary, in obedience to God.
What are you willing to give up in obedience to God? Possessions?
Security? Time? God is SEARCHing for FAITH!
