_Matthew 5:14  
Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot
be hid._

Felix Adler said, "The hero is the one who kindles a great light in
the world, who sets up blazing torches in the dark streets of life for
men to see by." Both our verse and this quote emphasize that YOU are
to be a LIGHT in your world. When you speak and act out FAITH, it
will illuminate your world. Don't hide! SHINE! You are to be a holy
hill in the midst of your city, shining forth God's message of
hope!
