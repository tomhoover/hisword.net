_Ephesians 1:19  
And what is the exceeding greatness of His power to usward who
believe, according to the working of His mighty power._

Prayer releases the power and wisdom of God into every situation in
your life. God longs to be intimately involved with you, and to do
great things in your life. What's the hold-up? God's waiting for you
to pray, believing!
