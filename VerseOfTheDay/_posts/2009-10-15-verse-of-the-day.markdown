_Isaiah 30:18  
And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you,
and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you:
for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for
him._

What is the delay in Jesus returning to this earth as He promised?
The LORD is "extremely" gracious and merciful, wanting all who will,
to accept Him as their personal Savior. The delay is really because
of God's Extreme Love. While you are waiting on His return, share
God's love by telling someone about Jesus, before it's too late!
