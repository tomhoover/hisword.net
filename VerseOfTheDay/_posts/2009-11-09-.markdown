title: November 9th - Extreme Love...Is Kind
---

_Psalm 143:10  
Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good;
lead me into the land of uprightness._

Mondays can be hard for everyone! You could make this a great day
for someone, by deciding to show a random act of kindness to an
undeserving person. The Lord will lead you to just the people that
need it the most, if you will be open to His will and direction for
your life. Make this a great Monday for someone else and yourself!
