_Isaiah 40:29  
He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he
increaseth strength._

Sometimes a situation looks hopeless, and we may assume that God
does not care about us. Don't be overcome with doubt and fear.
Instead, call upon the Lord. He promises to give power and strength
to those who are weak and in hopeless situations. Don't give up!
Today may be the day that God brings a change into your life.
