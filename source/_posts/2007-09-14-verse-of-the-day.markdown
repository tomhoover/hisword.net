_II Chronicles 7:14  
If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves,
and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will
I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their
land._

It is not just individuals who can turn from or back to God. It is
evident that as the people of God, the Jews, could turn here, that
the people of God today, as a local church, can turn from or back to
God now. Sometimes, the repentant heart and changed life of one
person can steer an entire congregation toward a Christ-centered
direction.
