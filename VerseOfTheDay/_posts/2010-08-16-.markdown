title: August 16th - Extreme Love...hopes and believes the best.
---

_Romans 8:36-37  
As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we
are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we
are more than conquerors through him that loved us._

You may be at a point in your life where it doesn't look like you
are making any personal progress. You might have had your faith tried
lately, or you just might be discouraged with all the present evil in
this world. Re-read our verse. Because of Jesus' loving sacrifice,
you can be more than a conqueror. In other words, you are enabled,
through HOPE, to see yourself on the other side having already
overcome the battles of this life. God's EXTREME LOVE has brought you
HOPE today!
