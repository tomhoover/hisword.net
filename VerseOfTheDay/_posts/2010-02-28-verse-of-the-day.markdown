_Nehemiah 9:31  
Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly
consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful
God._

You don't deserve God's grace and mercy in your life. Therefore you
must also be gracious to those in your life who don't deserve mercy
and grace. God liberally fills your life with His grace and expects
you to pour His grace into the lives of others. How you handle the
grace of God often determines how God will respond to you. If you
need some grace today, it would be good to give it to others!
