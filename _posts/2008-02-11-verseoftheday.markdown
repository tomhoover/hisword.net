title: February 11th - God's Place of Presence
---

_Luke 9:23  
And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me._

It's Monday! Do I have to pick up that cross again today? Do I have
to put my personal feelings and desires aside for God and others every
day? You must answer that yourself, but be reminded, God doesn't take
a day off.
