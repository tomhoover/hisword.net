_Deuteronomy 6:5  
And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with
all thy soul, and with all thy might._

It&rsquo;s the time of the year where you see hearts everywhere you
look. Every time you see a heart today, share God&rsquo;s love with
someone around you. Love changes lives!
