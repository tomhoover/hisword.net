_Isaiah 46:4  
And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I
carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will
deliver you._

Are you worried about your economic future? Are you having problems
choosing the right presidential candidate? God promises to take care
of you, even if social security fails. Make good biblical choices,
and God will take care of you. He promised!
