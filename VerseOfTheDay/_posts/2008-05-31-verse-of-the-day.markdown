_Revelation 17:14  
These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome
them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are
with him are called, and chosen, and faithful._

It&rsquo;s the last day of May. You are also living in the last
days before the return of Jesus Christ. Life passes with lightning
speed. You are on this earth, for only a short time, so you must be
diligent and live life wisely. You will appear before God tomorrow
&ndash; so live for Him today!
