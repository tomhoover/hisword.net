_I John 3:1  
Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us
not, because it knew him not._

The Holidays are synonymous with family. When you are a child of
God, you get to celebrate being a part of the family all year long!
Celebrate the Father's great love today! There are lots of needy
people, who are looking for purpose and acceptance. Tell those in
your world that there's room for more in God's family.
