_Colossians 3:21  
Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be
discouraged._

It's not an easy job being a parent, and then this verse goes and
qualifies your anger. It's only natural that parents are going to get
upset with their children when they break the rules, but parents are
told to be careful how they speak to their children. Parents must
temper their correction with unconditional love, or a child will feel
rejected and react in anger. The heavenly Father says that nothing
will separate His children from His love. He promotes this Extreme
Unconditional Love as a goal for each and every parent and home. It's
not easy, but parents, you can do it with God's help!
