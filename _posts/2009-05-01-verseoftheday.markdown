title: May 1st - Partnership with God in Attitude and Mind-Set
---

_Psalm 19:14  
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer._

The Psalmist understood what it took to have the proper attitude
and mind-set. He knew that God saw directly into his heart, and it
didn&rsquo;t matter so much what others thought, but his words and
actions must please God. The strength to say and do the right thing,
today, comes from a partnership with God. Don't leave home without
His help!
