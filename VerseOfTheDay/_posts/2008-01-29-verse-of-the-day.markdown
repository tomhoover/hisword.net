_Isaiah 41:10  
Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy
God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will
uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness._

Every time you feel the wind blow or air moving today, remind
yourself that God is with you and His right hand is holding yours.
