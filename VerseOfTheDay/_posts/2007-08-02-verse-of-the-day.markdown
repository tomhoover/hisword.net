_Isaiah 40:11  
He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs
with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead
those that are with young._

In context here, the flock is His people, Israel, now dispersed in
a foreign land; yet even though they are scattered because of their
disobedience and rebellion, He still loves them and longs to lead
them as a Shepherd. The prophet looks to the future when the sheep
will allow their Shepherd to feed, gather, carry and lead them. You,
as a believer, may be walking without Jesus. You know it, but can't
yet admit it and repent of it, but you know it is why you have no
real peace in your heart. God loves you so much that He is your
shepherd, even when you are merely wearing sheep's clothing.
