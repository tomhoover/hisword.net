_Ephesians 6:17  
And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which
is the word of God._

A helmet is used to provide protection for your head. God has given
you a free will to think and do as you please, but He has also given
you some protective armor for your head. The Words of God are
powerful, and if you will put them in your mind, they will protect
you. Don't forget to put on your helmet today!! Head injuries can be
fatal!
