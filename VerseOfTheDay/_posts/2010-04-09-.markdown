title: April 9th - Extreme Love...works at overcoming anger.
---

_Ephesians 4:26  
Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath._

Our verse tells us that anger is something every human being deals
with on a daily basis. Christians can, and should, get upset when
"the name of Christ" is ridiculed. This is called righteous
indignation. The Christian, however, is not to take things into their
own hands, this would be sin. Instead, Christians are to pray and to
give it God . Give your anger to God, and leave it in the past!
/Anger should not carry over from one day to the next./ Deal with
your anger so that God's LOVE remains your focus.
