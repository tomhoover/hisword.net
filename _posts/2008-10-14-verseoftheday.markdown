title: October 14th - The Basics of Partnership
---

_I John 3:24  
And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him.
And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the spirit which he hath
given us._

Your Partner will talk to you today, if you will take time to
listen to Him. Begin your day reading God&rsquo;s words and
commandments. They will find a voice in your life and save you from
harm and destruction, if you will embrace them with all your heart.
