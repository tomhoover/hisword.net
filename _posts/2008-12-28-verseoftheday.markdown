_Psalm 27:11  
Teach me Thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path, because of
mine enemies._

In the old days, a man who saved money was a miser; nowadays he's a
wonder! Ask the Lord, as your Partner in all things, to teach you how
to be wise with your money, so you can use it for His honor and
glory.
