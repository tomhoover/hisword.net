_I Corinthians 15:33  
Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners._

Don't be fooled! You can't think evil thoughts continually without
them eventually being acted out in your life, and you suffering the
consequences of them. What you say to yourself, and allow to enter
into your mind, is so important. You need help if you are going to
keep the proper focus. Ask God to help you keep your thoughts pure
and holy!
