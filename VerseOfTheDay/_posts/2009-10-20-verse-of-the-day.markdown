_Hebrews 6:15  
And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise._

Be encouraged, patience will come to an end one day! But you aren't
there yet, so keep being patient with the difficult people in your
life. Be patient when you are treated unjustly. Be patient and endure
when you want to quit your job and be a hermit. Be patient and one day
you will obtain the promise!
