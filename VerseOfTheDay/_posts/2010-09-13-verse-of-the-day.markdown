_Philippians 4:13  
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me._

This is your "secret weapon" verse. It's an easy verse to memorize
and quote to the enemy when he sows doubts and fears in your mind.
You might even need to raise the level of your voice when you quote
it to him, to make sure he understands you are not going to be shaken
off course! Lift it up! You can, do all things through Jesus Christ!
