_I Corinthians 16:13  
Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong._

WATCH OUT! A Christian is always in danger, and therefore he should
always be on guard. You must hold your ground, your FAITH, firm in God
and His Word. There is a prevalent attitude in the world today
regarding Christian service. Many Christians want to do a minimum,
just enough to keep God and His people off their back. Our verse says
that if you don't watch out, you can slip into that same mind set. Ask
God to help you to be strong in FAITH, always desiring to bring glory
to Him!
