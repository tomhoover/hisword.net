_Psalm 34:1  
I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be
in my mouth._

Are you tired today? /"When you feel dog tired at night, it might
be because you've growled all day long!"/ Instead of growling at
everything, "Praise the Lord!" It will help you feel better, whether
your circumstances change or not. Take the "Praise Challenge," and
praise God continually. You will feel better and have more energy!
