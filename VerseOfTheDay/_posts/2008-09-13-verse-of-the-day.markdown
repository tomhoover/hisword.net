_Matthew 6:12  
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors._

"You owe, You owe, so off to work you go!" As you are working
throughout your day to pay your debtors, thank God for health and
strength to work. Also be mindful of the debt you owe God: to forgive
the offenses of others, as He has forgiven you.
