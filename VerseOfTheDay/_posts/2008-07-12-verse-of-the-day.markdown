_Hebrews 7:25  
Wherefore He is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto
God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them._

Jesus Christ gave His life so that you might be connected to God
the Father. You must see your need of forgiveness and place your
faith in Jesus Christ. After salvation, Jesus still connects us to
God the Father through prayer. Jesus takes your prayers to God the
Father, and your prayers are put before the Creator of the universe.
Have you under-rated your prayers lately? God is known to move heaven
and earth for His faithful children.
