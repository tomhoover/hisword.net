_Isaiah 61:3  
To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty
for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the
spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness,
the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified._

When you accept God's hand in your life, He will make the ugly seem
beautiful, turn your tears to joy, and put praise on your lips that He
might be glorified.
