_Numbers 14:18  
The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity
and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the
iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
generation._

It's a sad reality that our sins, although they can be forgiven,
reap consequences of their own. This is the reason, that you should
avoid sin at all cost, because every sin carries some consequences.
Your sin will even affect your children and grandchildren. Purpose to
say, "No!", when temptation enters your mind. Ask for the Lord help as
He wants to help you do right today!
