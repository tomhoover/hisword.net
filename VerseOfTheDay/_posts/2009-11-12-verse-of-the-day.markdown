_Psalm 119:76  
Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according
to thy word unto thy servant._

If you find yourself needing some encouragement there is hope
today. The wonderful God of the Bible is looking down from heaven in
mercy, longing to comfort and encourage you. He would tell you that
His EXTREME LOVE for you is eternal, reaching into the deepest depth
of your soul. This same love is at work in your life today! Share
it!
