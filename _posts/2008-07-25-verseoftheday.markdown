title: July 25th - God&rsquo;s Place of Salvation
---

_Psalm 54:1  
Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength._

Don&rsquo;t take the name of God lightly. There is power when you
call upon Him to help and strengthen you. As your prayers are
answered, you begin to see and understand that there is no other name
on earth that can save, like Jehovah God! Celebrate God&rsquo;s power
in your life today!
