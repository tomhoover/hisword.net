_John 20:27  
Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my
hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be
not faithless, but believing._

Our God is wonderful beyond words! There are times in our lives
when God understands that we need to "touch" Him in order to
strengthen our FAITH. Most often His "touch" comes in some form of an
affirmation that He's working in your life. Maybe He speaks to you
from His Word, or He might use impossible circumstances to display
His power and presence in your life. Spend some time with your
wonderful God today. Thank Him for the "touch" that affirms His
presence. FAITH is believing!
