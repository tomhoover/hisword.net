title: September 9th - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Isaiah 55:7  
Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy
upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon._

Would you like to stay out of trouble today? Do you sometimes say
or do things that you shouldn't? The Lord stands ready to help you,
but your part begins when you decide that you are going to think
right. Our verse reminds us that it starts in our minds. Ask God to
give you thoughts, words, and actions, that would bring Him glory.
