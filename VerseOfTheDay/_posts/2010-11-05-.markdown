_Galatians 5:22-23  
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there
is no law._

An initial FAITH in Jesus Christ as your Savior, will give you
God's gift of the fruit of the Spirit in your life. This fruit is
like fruit on a tree, it GROWS! It has great potential if it is
watered! Have you noticed that some Christians seem to do a better
job of watering? When you see love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness and self-control in the life of a Christian,
you can know that they are watering their FAITH. They take God
seriously! Do you?
