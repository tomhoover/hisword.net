title: November 2nd - Extreme Love...Is Kind
---

_Luke 6:35  
But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing
again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children
of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil._

Have you ever resented someone because they did not acknowledge
your gift to them? If you will think upon the fact that nothing is
really yours to begin with, it might help you to let go of those
feelings. Consider the fact that everything you have, comes from the
Lord. Have you thanked the Lord for all He's given you to be able to
share with others? If you have a heart that recognizes God's kindness
and blessing, it will help you to be kind to those unthankful people
in your life.
