_Colossians 1:27  
To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this
mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of
glory._

It really is a mystery why God, Who could use anything in this
world to proclaim His authenticity, would want to use a human life to
declare Himself. If you are His child, Christ in you should be the
HOPE that others see. Your relationship with Christ defines and
declares how you live your life. Your HOPE should be a picture of
faith holding its hand out to a dark world. You are a HOPE
representative today! Be what you are!
