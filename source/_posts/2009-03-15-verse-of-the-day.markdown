_Isaiah 50:4  
The Lord hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know
how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth mine
ear to hear as the learned._

Some people just know how to say the right thing at the right time
to cheer weary hearts. If you will call upon the Lord and ask Him to
help you, you can be one of those people. Ask God to guide you and
give you the words today to be a blessing and encouragement to
others.
