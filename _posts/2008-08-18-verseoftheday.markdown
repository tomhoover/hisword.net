title: August 18th - God&rsquo;s Place of Faithfulness
---

_Psalm 119:90  
Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: Thou hast established the
earth, and it abideth._

Just as God has secured the earth in place, He also secures and
keeps His promises, passing them down from one generation to another.
Every time you put your foot on the ground today, be reminded that
God&rsquo;s promises are just as solid for you as they were for Adam
and Eve.
