_Isaiah 25:9  
And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have
waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited
for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation._

This is not just any ordinary day! Every day is a celebration, if
you have had your sins forgiven. One day, you are going to live in a
beautiful place called heaven. You will experience constant love, joy
and peace. Your body will be perfect and without pain. (Thought that
would get your attention!) Even though you're in the waiting room
right now, God wants you to smile and rejoice in your salvation!
