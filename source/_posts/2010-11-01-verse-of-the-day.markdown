_II Peter 1:5  
And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and
to virtue knowledge._

Begin with FAITH! You might picture FAITH as the roots of a tree.
These roots become the foundation that not only sustains the life of
the tree, but determines its growth. FAITH in your life provides
salvation (eternal life) and the basis for Christian growth. Our
verse starts with FAITH and wants you to APPLY FAITH to every area of
your life. FAITH isn't something we get over, it's something that
should be continually growing. Is your FAITH stronger today than it
was yesterday? Take the challenge and APPLY FAITH to every part of
your life.
