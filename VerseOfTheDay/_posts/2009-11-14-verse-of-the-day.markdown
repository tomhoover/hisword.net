title: November 14th - Extreme Love...Is Kind
---

_Psalm 17:7  
Show thy marvelous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right
hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up
against them._

Have you ever had a situation when you looked back and knew it was
God that had protected you from doing or saying something that might
have hurt a relationship? When you are focused on obeying God, He
will help you treat people with kindness even when you think you
can't. God will help you build good relationships, if you will ask
for His help.
