_Hebrews 13:16  
But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such
sacrifices God is well pleased._

All relationships take work! Part of that is remembering to express
your love and concern for people in your life. Take the time to show
or tell three people how important they are to you, today. It may
require a sacrifice on your part, but God will be pleased and you
will be better for it.
