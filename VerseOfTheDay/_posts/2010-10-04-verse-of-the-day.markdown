_Matthew 17:20  
And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say
unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say
unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall
remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you._

Our verse challenges us as to the impact that even a small amount
of FAITH can make in this world. When you speak words of FAITH amidst
the negative voices around you, God will stand out like a bright
light! When you proclaim and believe God's promises to provide your
needs, your FAITH, no matter how small, has been launched. The key to
this verse is, "if you have FAITH!" If you do, God promises to provide
the impossible!
