_Haggai 2:4b  
Be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for
I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts._

You may not enjoy working, but God made you to work, and you are
really your happiest when you are able to work. There are many people
in this world, who would love to be able to work. Take a minute to
thank God for the ability to work, and it will put a smile on your
face.
