_Psalm 40:2  
He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay,
and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings._

Do you ever feel like you&rsquo;re stuck in a rut and the world is
passing you by? There is no high, like the Most High, to restore your
vision and purpose for life.
