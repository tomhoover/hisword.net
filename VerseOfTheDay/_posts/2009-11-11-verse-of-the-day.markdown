title: November 11th - Extreme Love...Is Kind
---

_Nehemiah 9:17b  
But thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to
anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not._

God doesn't forsake you when you get too busy to spend time with
Him, or you replace Him with your own agenda. In His great kindness,
God doesn't leave you, but He does miss His time with you. Take a
minute to praise the God of great kindness and EXTREME LOVE!
He&rsquo;s listening for your praise!
