_Romans 8:31  
What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be
against us?_

If you have a relationship with the almighty GOD, you've got it!
You've got the most precious treasure you can ever have in a
lifetime! Think about it! If you have GOD in your heart, there is
nothing in this earth that can even come close! You can face anything
and everyone with HIS STRENGTH! He's for you, Christian! Believe His
Words and live it out today!
