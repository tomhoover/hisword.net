title: April 8th - Extreme Love...works at overcoming anger.
---

_Proverbs 17:19  
He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his
gate seeketh destruction._

Extreme Love requires that you set aside your desires and focus on
the desires of others. If you think only of yourself, you can be sure
your relationships with others will suffer. When you promote yourself
over others, it is called pride, and that is sin. Start your day off
with the proper attitude toward yourself and others. You will have a
better day, when "love" becomes a priority.
