title: October 21st - The Basics of Partnership
---

_Psalm 145:18  
The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon Him, to all that call
upon Him in truth._

Long lasting relationships and partnerships must be built upon
truth if they are going to endure. It's good to know that if God says
something, He will do it, because He cannot lie. Who else can be this
dependable? Celebrate a faithful God who is committed to a
truth-based relationship with you!
