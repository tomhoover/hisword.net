_Colossians 3:12-13a  
12 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels
of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;  
13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another._

The above verse has been given to prepare your heart for some
situation in your life today. If you will purpose to be kind to
everyone, no matter the circumstances, your mind-set will please God.
In fact, He will help you if you will but call upon His name. You are
sure to have a great day when you include your Partner.
