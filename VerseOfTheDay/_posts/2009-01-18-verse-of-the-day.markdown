_Psalm 25:4  
Shew me Thy ways, O Lord; teach me Thy paths._

Did God talk to you at church today about making some kind of
change in your life? They say that you should commit yourself one day
at a time to a change or resolution for your life. It keeps goals
always before you, and more importantly it keeps your daily
dependence upon God to show you how to be like Him.
