_Isaiah 41:13  
For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee,
Fear not; I will help thee._

Is there some place you don&rsquo;t like to go to by yourself? All
of us, from time to time, will find ourselves in dangerous
situations. If you find yourself there, picture God holding your
right hand and saying, &ldquo;Fear not, I will help you.&rdquo;
