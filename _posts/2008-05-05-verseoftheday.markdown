title: May 5th - God&rsquo;s Place of Victory
---

_Romans 8:28  
And we know that all things work together for good to them that love
God, to them who are the called according to his purpose._

It&rsquo;s Monday, you know what that means! The adversary will try
to get you to forget the victories of yesterday. Be reminded that
everything today will be profitable for your good, if you see beyond
the circumstance and focus on God&rsquo;s love for you.
