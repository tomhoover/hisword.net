title: May 5th - Partnership with God in Attitude and Mind-Set
---

_II Timothy 1:7  
For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
love, and of a sound mind._

You can live your life chained by fear or by accessing the power of
God. Believers who have the "right mind-set," know that God's love
secures them and they need not fear. Stop and ask God to help you
keep His loving Presence in your mind throughout this day.
