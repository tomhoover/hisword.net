title: January 5th - Extreme Love...Is not proud or self-focused
---

_Ephesians 5:21  
Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God._

It can be a scary thing to submit to someone else. After all, you
could be putting your life in their hands. The truth is, we must
submit out of love, in respect to God first, trusting and believing,
He will care for us in every relationship. It could be fearful, if
you didn't believe God's love was the strongest force in your life.
God says, "Love those around you, and trust Me for the rest."
