_Matthew 5:9  
Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children
of God._

Are you a peacemaker? A peacemaker cares about the feelings of
others and wants to bring harmony into a situation. We are most like
God, when we are peacemakers. By the way, the life of the peacemaker
is what brings happiness for all, and makes God proud.
