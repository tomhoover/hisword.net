_Luke 11:9-10  
9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye
shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.  
10 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth;
and to him that knocketh it shall be opened._

ASK: Ask, Seek, and Knock. Comparing this verse with other verses
on prayer, if we walk in the will of God through obedience to His
Word, and pray in the will of God, as the Holy Spirit will direct us,
whatever we ask in prayer will be given; whatever we seek in prayer we
will find; and whatever door of prayer we knock on, it will be opened.
Remember, what we are given, find, and is opened in prayer, may not be
as we expected it, but will be what God knows is best.
