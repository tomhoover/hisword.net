_Psalm 32:8  
I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go:
I will guide thee with mine eye._

Praise the Lord you don't have to have all the answers for life!
God promises that if you will submit to Him, His eye will guide and
care for you. Those are encouraging words when there are so many
decisions that you must make every day. You are not alone, the
Creator of the world is at work in your life! Look to His LIGHT in
FAITH!
