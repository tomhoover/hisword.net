_Psalm 25:21  
Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee._

Integrity is doing the right thing, whether you are being watched
or not. Christians should have the integrity to be the same person at
church as they are at home. Ask God to help you be an example of His
righteousness to others today!
