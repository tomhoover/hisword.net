_Genesis 22:14  
And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah jireh: as it is
said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen._

Have you ever been doubtful of God's provision in your life? When
you elevate your thinking, you will be able to see God's wise
provision for what you really need in life.
