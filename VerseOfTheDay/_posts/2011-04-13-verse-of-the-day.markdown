_Hebrews 2:14  
Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he
also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he
might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil._

Mankind has been in a struggle with the enemy ever since the days
of Adam and Eve. It is a struggle between right and wrong, life and
death. Since the cross, however, we have a new mind set. Jesus
conquered sin, death, and the grave, and because of this, you have
help with your ever present struggle to do right. One day, sin and
death will be destroyed for good. Until then, you need God's help to
live the Christian life. Ask Jesus to LIFT you out of your struggle,
and then REST in Him!
