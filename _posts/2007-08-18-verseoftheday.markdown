_Psalm 33:13-14  
13 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.  
14 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the
inhabitants of the earth._

It is one of our choicest privileges to be always under our
Father's eye, to be never out of sight of our best Friend. It is
true! If you seek to walk in obedience to God, Jesus said, "Ye are my
friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth I call you not
servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have
called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I
have made known unto you."
