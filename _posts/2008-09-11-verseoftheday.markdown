title: September 11th - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Mark 11:25  
And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any:
that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your
trespasses._

Are your prayers reaching heaven? One of the greatest
demonstrations of faith and trust in God, is when a Christian can lay
aside his pride, and will choose to forgive those that hurt him.
"Never does the human soul appear so strong and noble as when it
foregoes revenge and dares to forgive an injury."- Edwin H. Chapin
