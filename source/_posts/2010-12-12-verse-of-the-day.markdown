_Matthew 4:16  
The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which
sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up._

There are more wealthy people upon this earth than at any previous
time. Some of those who seemingly have the most, are the most
miserable. They are sitting in darkness with no purpose or hope after
this life. Jesus came to bring LIGHT to their dark, hopeless
situations. As you see the LIGHTS of Christmas everywhere, be
reminded of the great need in the lives of others.
