_Mark 8:36-37  
For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world,
and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his
soul?_

The commercial world puts lots of emphasis on the material side of
Christmas. In this busy time, be sure and share the "good news" with
all the people that God should bring into your life. Can you put a
value on a person's eternal soul? God did. He loved you so much He
gave His best, Jesus, to die for you. Give your best back to Him
today!
