title: April 12th- God&rsquo;s Place of Care
---

_I Peter 5:7  
Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you._

Are you carrying a burden today? Are you going through a hard time?
God allows these things to come into our lives so we will seek His
help. You were not made to carry burdens. Give them to God. He cares
for you!
