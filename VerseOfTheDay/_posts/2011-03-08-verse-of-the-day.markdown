_Hebrews 11:10  
For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and
maker is God._

Imagine what the city of God will look like! God created so many
beautiful things upon earth, but heaven will be amazing beyond your
imagination! It's like settling for a shack when you could have a
mansion! This earth is nothing compared to what you will have in
heaven. Until then, be satisfied with your shack and be busy doing
God's will! Make no mistake though, heaven will be worth every
sacrifice you make for God upon this earth!
