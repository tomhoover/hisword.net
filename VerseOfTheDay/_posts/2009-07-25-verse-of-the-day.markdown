_Isaiah 48:10  
Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee
in the furnace of affliction._

This could be one of those days when God purposes to change you
more into His image. Don't focus on the pain or hurt in your life,
instead ask for an awareness of His Presence in you life.
