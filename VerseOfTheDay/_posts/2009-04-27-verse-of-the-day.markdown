title: April 27th - Partnership with God for a Victorious Life
---

_Joshua 1:9  
Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not
afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee
whithersoever thou goest._

Dwight D. Eisenhower said, /"There is no victory at bargain
basement prices."/ Victory will cost something. In other words,
victory won't happen without you doing your part. We are commanded to
be strong and focused on the Lord being with us. This will give you
the courage to do the unthinkable. Be willing to sacrifice to get the
victory, today!
