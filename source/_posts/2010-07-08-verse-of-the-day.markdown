_I Corinthians 15:57  
But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord
Jesus Christ._

The victory over death, the grave, and the Christian walk, are
through our Lord Jesus Christ, and Him alone. Anything good about
anyone upon this earth, is because of Jesus, not themselves. If you
find yourself weighted down by this world, it could be you are trying
to get the victory through your own efforts. Rest in the fact that the
victory is already won, and He will provide the power for you to keep
going until He calls you home! Thank Him for blessing you today!
