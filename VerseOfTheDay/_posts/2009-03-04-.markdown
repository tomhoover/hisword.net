title: March 4th - Partnership with God to Touch Lives
---

_Romans 10:13  
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved._

There are difficult people in our lives, who we can come to think,
will never give their hearts to Jesus Christ. The "whosoever" in our
verse includes everyone, and excludes no one. Ask God to renew your
faith and to give you the courage to tell them one more time about
this most important decision for their life.
