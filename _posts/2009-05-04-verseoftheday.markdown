title: May 4th - Partnership with God in Attitude and Mind-Set
---

_Deuteronomy 26:11a  
And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the Lord thy God
hath given unto thee, and unto thou house._

There are so many good things in life that you are continually
overlooking. It could be a house, a flower, a friend, or eternal
salvation through Jesus Christ. Make a point to tell someone today
about God's overlooked blessings in your life. You will find the
attitude of "joy" filling your heart when you count your blessings!
