title: August 31st - Partnership with God for a Changed Life
---

_Colossians 1:10  
That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of
God._

The best change you can make in your life, is to purpose to know
God better and to be more like Him. This pleases God! He wants to
share life with you and change you to make your life better. What do
you know about God today, that you didn't know yesterday?
