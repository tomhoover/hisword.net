_Isaiah 17:10  
Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not
been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shall thou plant
pleasant plants, and shall set it with strange slips._

What have you forgotten today? Did you brush your teeth? Did you
comb your hair? Did you remember what day this is? If you
aren&rsquo;t careful you can forget to include GOD in your life. God
is your strength and salvation, don&rsquo;t start the day without
Him. You are going to need Him today!
