title: May 3rd - God&rsquo;s Place of Victory
---

_I Corinthians 15:57  
But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord
Jesus Christ._

Do you need victory in your life today? Do you need help for your
mind, mouth, and methods? If you are wise, you will begin your day
acknowledging past victories and asking for present help through our
Lord Jesus Christ.
