_Jeremiah 29:11  
For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD,
thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end._

WOW! God is thinking about you right now. What's He thinking about
you? It depends upon your relationship with Him. We often go our own
way, seeking the fun and evil things of this world and not thinking
of the end result. God puts roadblocks in our paths to bring us back
to His place of peace. God's thoughts and plans are for you to have a
wonderful life. You may think that God has forgotten you and doesn't
care, but He says that's not true. Because of His Extreme Love, He
thinks about you constantly.
