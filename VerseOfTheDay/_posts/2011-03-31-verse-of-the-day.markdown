_Psalm 31:24  
Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that
hope in the LORD._

If you find yourself needing encouragement today, you have found a
wonderful verse to help you. God promises that He will do His part
and will strengthen your heart. There is a condition for this
encouragement; however, you must hope, or put your FAITH in Him! Over
and over this month we have been reminded of the power of God in the
lives of those who have put their FAITH in Him. You can build your
life on this same FAITH! It's a choice!
