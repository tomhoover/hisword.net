_Romans 12:1  
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable service._

If you are a Christian, God has some reasonable expectations for
your life. Faithful service is something most everyone can give. When
you are tired and want to stay home rather than go to church, remember
it&rsquo;s "your reasonable service."
