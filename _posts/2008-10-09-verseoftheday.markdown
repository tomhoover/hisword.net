title: October 9th - The Basics of Partnership
---

_Ezra 8:22b  
The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek Him._

When we shake someone's hand, it often means that we are in
agreement with them on something. Keeping that image in your mind,
think of God as your partner, and your agreement to serve Him. God's
hand is reaching out to you. Will you give your hand to Him in
agreement? The blessings of this very day are secured through your
partnership with God.
