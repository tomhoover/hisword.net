_Proverbs 16:6  
By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD
men depart from evil._

Sin is a problem for everyone! Someone said, "Rather than saying
'God, here is my problem,' we should put the problem into perspective
by saying 'Problem, here is my God!'" Whoever wrote those words
understood that there is no problem God cannot handle in our lives.
His MERCY comforts us, and His TRUTH assures us that we can overcome
the power of sin in our lives, with His help!
