_Isaiah 43:2  
When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest
through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame
kindle upon thee._

This is a very interesting verse, given by God to encourage you
today. Someone said that this particular verse covers most of the
things that will happen in life of a believer. Your life is made up
of waters, rivers, fires, and flames. They are pictured as
afflictions, temptations, persecutions, and trials. The best part of
this verse is the fact that God promises to be with you in all. He
not only is with you, but He has made a path through the water,
through the river, through the fire, and through the flame. You need
not be overcome by any of these, because God will lead you through
them, if you will WALK by FAITH!
