_Hebrews 11:22  
By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the
children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones._

If anyone could have given up on God, it might have been Joseph!
His life was a continual test of FAITH. He did good and time after
time suffered for it. Yet, we see him at the end of his life, still
speaking FAITH! His identity remained steadfast in his GOD! People,
as they get older, either become "bitter or better" for their trials
of FAITH. Which is it for you? What word best describes you today?
