_James 1:18  
Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should
be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures._

Do you feel special today? Well you are! God, in His LOVE, chose to
give us the Gospel, or word of TRUTH, and because of that, we, out of
all His creation, became His choice possession. If you are God's
child today, REJOICE! You've got great things ahead of you! For the
Christian, earth is just a stopover. Heaven is our destination, and
we may go there sooner than we think.
