_John 11:27  
She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ,
the Son of God, which should come into the world._

We can all be like Martha in our verse from time to time. She
believed that Jesus was the Christ or Messiah of the world, and He
had saved her soul. The problem was, she didn't carry that belief in
Jesus, over into her everyday life with its problems. Like Martha, we
can believe God for salvation, but when it comes to our daily burdens,
we somehow don't believe He will help us. Do you believe Jesus is who
He said He was? Then live like it today! Think FAITH and live it
out!
