_Psalm 119:165  
Great peace have they which love thy law; and nothing shall offend
them._

Choose your battles today! God&rsquo;s Word says that we should
turn the other cheek, rather than take offense. This means you just
need to choose to let some things go. Although this can be hard to
do, it will bring peace to your relationships. Choose peace!
