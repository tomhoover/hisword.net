_Philippians 4:13  
I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me._

Happy New Year! It's 2009! You have been given a "new beginning"
today. Take a moment to assess your life and set some challenging
goals that can only be accomplished with your Partner's help. Don't
sell yourself short; You can do things you never imagined, through
Jesus Christ, your Partner and direct power source!
