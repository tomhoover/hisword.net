_Romans 12:19  
Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto
wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the
Lord._

Sometime in the course of this day, you will be tempted to give
someone the same treatment that they give you. When this happens,
think back to this verse, and turn them over to God. It will keep a
smile on your face!
