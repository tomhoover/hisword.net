_Psalm 118:24  
This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be
glad in it._

God has given you this day on planet earth, and you should be happy
and praise Him! As believers, we declare our praise in the midst of
the church through our presence and expressions. Your face should
light up and glow as you envision the Almighty God hearing your words
of song rise up to Him in the heavens. Don't leave your praise at the
church, take it home with you, and share it with a dark world.
