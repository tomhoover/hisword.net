_John 16:33  
These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace.
In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have
overcome the world._

Do you have something that is troubling you? God wants to take your
burdens, and give you His peace. As long as you insist on worrying
about your problems, peace and victory will elude you. Victory is a
sure thing for the unshakable God.
