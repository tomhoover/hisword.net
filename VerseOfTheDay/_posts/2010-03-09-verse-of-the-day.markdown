_I Peter 3:15  
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to
give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that
is in you with meekness and fear._

Get ready! Through your actions and words you will tell a watching
world, today, whether you live with hope or fear. You are admonished
in our verse, to prepare your heart through prayer, so that you will
display the proper attitude. Give "hope" to everyone you meet, and be
sure to tell them that this "hope" is found in Jesus Christ! Get
ready, someone is watching your life!
