_Hebrews 10:31  
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God._

What are you looking forward to in 2008? If you have given your
heart to Jesus, you have no reason to be fearful. As a follower of
Christ, we have a bright future, but what about your friends? Share
God&rsquo;s touch today.
