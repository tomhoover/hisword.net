_I Timothy 1:14  
And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love
which is in Christ Jesus._

Have you ever had someone believe in you when you didn't deserve
it, or when no one else would? That's what our verse is saying. The
Lord knows you in and out, the good and the bad, and He still has
abundant faith and love for you. That's grace! You can celebrate a
faithful God, who looks at the heart, and not the mistakes you make.
Carry this thought with you today, and it will keep a smile upon your
face!
