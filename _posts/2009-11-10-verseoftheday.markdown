title: November 10th - Extreme Love...Is Kind
---

_Ephesians 2:7  
That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his
grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus._

We are reminded in our verse today that it is only because of God's
grace, giving us what we don't deserve, that we are so blessed in this
present age. If you have been so blessed, then you should extend that
same love and kindness to others as an extension of our Lord Jesus
Christ. What would grace look like in your life? A smile... an offer
to help... going beyond duty... spending extra time... giving up your
privileges and resources for others... loving a lonely heart on a busy
day.
