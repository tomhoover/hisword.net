_Ephesians 5:14  
Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the
dead, and Christ shall give thee light._

Wake up, child of God! Could your spiritual life use a bright
expression? God is waiting for His children to cry out to Him and ask
for His help. You must see your need. Get up and walk toward the
LIGHT! Don't start another year living in mediocrity! God deserves
better and He wants to make you better! FAITH-LIGHT will ignite your
life!
