_Proverbs 17:17  
A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity._

Do you know anyone going through a hard time right now? If you do,
you should encourage them! This verse calls you to be a friend to
someone today! Get to it! Write a card. Make a phone call. Visit a
shut-in. Get busy! You've been given an assignment for today!
