_Psalm 60:4  
Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be
displayed because of the truth._

The bravest people are given a banner to carry into their world
every day. If you choose to display your banner, some lost soul could
learn about the truth of Jesus Christ. Will you carry your banner
today or leave it at home?
