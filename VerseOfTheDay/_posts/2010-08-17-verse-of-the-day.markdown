_John 14:1  
Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in
me._

Imagine yourself physically meeting Jesus Christ in person. What
would you say to Him? Do you think you would remember all those
questions that go through your mind daily about His direction for
your life? Jesus has visited you today through our verse! He said,
"Don't get worked up over the things in this life, just BELIEVE in
Me." Did you hear Him? He's waiting for your response.
