_Proverbs 21:23  
Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from
troubles._

The tongue can get us in a lot of trouble, but it can also be used
to edify the Lord! You can make this a wonderful day for others, and
yourself, when you start it off by asking God to help you speak the
right things. Purpose to infuse words of encouragement, faith, and
hope in your conversations today. It will keep trouble away, and
peace will rule the day!
