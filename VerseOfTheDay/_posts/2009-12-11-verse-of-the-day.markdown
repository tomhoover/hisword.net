title: December 11th - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_John 17:3  
And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent._

TGIF.....Thank God I'm Forgiven! Can you say that? If you can, it's
all because you've asked God's Son, Jesus Christ, to forgive your sins
and come into your heart. This is eternal life! Recognizing that Jesus
Christ came to earth to die for your sins. One of the hymns we sing
during Christmas, says, "Let earth receive her King!" The name of the
hymn is "Joy To The World!" That pretty much sums up forgiveness and a
new relationship with Jesus Christ. JOY! Wear it on you face today!
