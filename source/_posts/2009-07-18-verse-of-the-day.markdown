_Hebrews 6:11  
And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to
the full assurance of hope unto the end._

You can't slow down or quit! You must be diligent to serve the Lord
until your last breath upon this earth! God has something for you to
do that no one else upon this earth can do. Every day is filled with
joy and purpose, when you represent the King!
