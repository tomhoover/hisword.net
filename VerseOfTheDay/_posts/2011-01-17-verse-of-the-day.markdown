_Joshua 1:9  
Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not
afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee
whithersoever thou goest._

There we go again! We forget that, as a Christian, God has promised
to go with us wherever we are. God's presence makes a radical
difference in a believer's life. A confident peace replaces fear and
anxiety when you know God is with you. It's called FAITH! God is
doing a FAITH check today on you. Don't forget He's promised to be
with you!
