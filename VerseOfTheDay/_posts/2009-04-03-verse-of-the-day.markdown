_John 16:33  
These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace.
In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have
overcome the world._

There will always be a struggle with something as long as you are
on this earth. You can chose to be pulled down by your problems, or
you can chose to focus on the peace that comes from trusting Jesus,
who overcame death and all the tribulations of this world. Live this
day with a focus on Jesus' overcoming power, and you will have
victory.
