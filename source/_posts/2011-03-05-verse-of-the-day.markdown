_Hebrews 11:7  
By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved
with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which
he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is
by faith._

It took enormous FAITH to build an ark in the midst of Noah's
generation! Noah must have wondered at times if he had really
understood God's command correctly. (Today that could be the voice of
this world questioning obedience and/or the mere existence of God.) In
the end, we know that Noah chose to believe God. Has God told you to
do something, and you are struggling with doubts? Follow Noah's
example and choose FAITH! Trust God for the things you can't see or
understand!
