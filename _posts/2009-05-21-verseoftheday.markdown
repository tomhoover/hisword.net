title: May 21st - Partnership with God in Attitude and Mind-Set
---

_II Corinthians 13:11  
Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of
one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with
you._

This verse of the day is brought to you by "maturity." The more
mature you become, the more you will realize that God's love and
peace is the most important thing in your life. Maturity creates in
you a desire to get along, and let the little stuff go.
Dear God, Please help us grow up and value Your love and peace in
our lives, more than having our way! In Jesus name, Amen.
