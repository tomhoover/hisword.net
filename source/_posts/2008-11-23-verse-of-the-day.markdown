_I Corinthians 11:24  
And when He had given thanks, He brake it, and said, Take, eat: this
is My body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me._

Imagine what it would be like to hear Jesus pray with His disciples
all gathered around Him. In this prayer, Jesus is thanking His
heavenly Father for being able to offer up His broken body for
mankind. When was the last time you thanked God for being able to
suffer for Him? Can you thank God for the trial that has brought you
closer to Him? May your prayers find new depth today.
