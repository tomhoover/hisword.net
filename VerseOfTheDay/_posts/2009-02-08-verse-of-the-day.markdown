title: February 8th - Partnership with God in Loving Relationships

_I John 4:20  
If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for
he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God
whom he hath not seen?_

Do you love God? Do you love all people? Our verse tells us that
there is a connection between your love for God and your love for
others. When you understand and believe that you are secure in God's
unconditional love, you can risk loving others. Don't be a liar. Be a
lover!
