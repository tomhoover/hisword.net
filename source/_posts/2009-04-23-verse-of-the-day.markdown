_Psalm 18:28  
For thou wilt light my candle: the Lord my God will enlighten my
darkness._

/"Even the children of the day, sometimes need candle-light."/
(Spurgeon)
We all have days, when nothing but God's flame can ignite our
hearts. God's light is like no other, as it can sustain in the midst
of heavy down-pours or raging winds. God's light warms your heart and
makes dark thoughts flee! Ask God to light your day.
