_Colossians 1:12  
Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be
partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light._

Have you seen the "lights of Christmas" everywhere you go? Every
time you see a Christmas light, say a quick "thank you" to God for
sending His Light, Jesus, into our dark world!
