title: July 21st - God&rsquo;s Place of Salvation
---

_Psalm 25:5  
Lead me in thy truth and teach me: for thou art the God of my
salvation; on thee do I wait all the day long._

You never are too old to learn, especially when it comes to the
things of God. One of the greatest lessons you can learn is that God
is never in a hurry. It&rsquo;s while you are waiting on Him that He
will teach you His best lessons. Ask God to lead you in His truth
today and wait patiently!
