_Acts 24:16  
And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of
offence toward God, and toward men._

Exercise?? Who said exercise wasn't in the Bible?? You have got to
be kidding! I don't have time for that in my schedule today! If you
told God or man that you would do something, you should keep your
word. Exercise your self-control today, and do what you said you
would.
