_John 12:46  
I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me
should not abide in darkness._

In spite of our nation's declination from Biblical principles and
morals, America is still basking in the Light of Christ and His free
gift of grace. We therefore don't see the darkness of this world as
clearly as it can be seen in so many other parts of the planet.
Still, in America, so many turn from the light and abide in darkness.
To abide in the light of life, ONE MUST BELIEVE. Repent, Believe, and
Receive Christ is the doctrine that defeats the darkness.
