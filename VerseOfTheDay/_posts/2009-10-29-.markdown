title: October 29th - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_James 5:8  
Be ye also patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of the
Lord draweth nigh._

Unfortunately, you are never given advance notice when patience
will be required in your life. With that in mind, if you will purpose
in your heart to make LOVE for God your motive in every situation that
comes your way, you will be more likely to respond with patience. In
these Extreme times, as the end is getting closer, showing God's
Extreme LOVE to others, will make the difference!
