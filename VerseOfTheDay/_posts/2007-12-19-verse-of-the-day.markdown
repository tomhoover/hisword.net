_James 1:5  
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all
men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him._

What do you want for Christmas? God says, if you want some wisdom,
and you ask for it, He will give it to you. This is a gift that
doesn't disappoint and might even save you some money!
