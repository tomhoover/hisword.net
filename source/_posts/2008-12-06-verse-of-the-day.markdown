_I Timothy 6:6-8  
6 But godliness with contentment is great gain.  
7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can
carry nothing out.  
8 And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content._

You can make this a very different Christmas season if you will
purpose to be someone who says, "In God I Trust", instead of "In
Money I Trust". Give more love and spend less money.
