_Hebrews 12:1  
Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud
of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth
so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set
before us._

There's nothing better than starting off the day with a "clean
slate." Ask God to cleanse your heart and help you to focus on Him
today. With God as your helper, you can endure and stay in the race.
Heaven's cheering for you today!
