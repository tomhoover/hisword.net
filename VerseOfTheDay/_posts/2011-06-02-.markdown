_Psalm 26:11  
But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be
merciful unto me._

The first verse in this Psalm (26:1) gives us a little
understanding of what David means when he refers to integrity.
According to that verse, you could substitute the word "faith" for
integrity. In today's verse David is saying that he, personally,
purposes to "walk in faith," and he needs God's mercy and redemption
to be able to do that. It's not a "solo walk!" FAITH in GOD is a
partnership! Remember this as you are "walking" from one place to
another throughout your day. God is walking with YOU!
