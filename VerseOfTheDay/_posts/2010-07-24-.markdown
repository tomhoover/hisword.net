title: July 24th - Extreme Love...endures and protects.
---

_Proverbs 27:6  
Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are
deceitful._

How fragile are your friendships? Can they withstand the truth
spoken in love? A real friend will tell you about the piece of
spinach that is stuck between your front teeth. It might wound your
pride for a second, but it is better than wearing spinach all day!
Remember that the best of friendships are built upon honesty and
humility. Lovingly encourage a friend today!
