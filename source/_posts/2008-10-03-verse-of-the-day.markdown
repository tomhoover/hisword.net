_Matthew 6:24  
No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and
love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the
other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon._

The partnership objective is to produce the character of Jesus
Christ and His works in your life and in this world. Sometimes the
reason your work is not going too well, is because you have forgotten
God's objective. God calls you to remember, today, that He's the
senior partner, and as the junior partner, you work to please Him,
not the world.
