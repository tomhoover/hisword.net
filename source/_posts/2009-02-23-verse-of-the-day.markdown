_I Thessalonians 3:12  
And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you._

It's almost the end of the month, and just when you think you can't
love anymore, the Lord asks you to increase your love! This is called
"going the extra mile!" Ask the Lord to put someone in your path
today, with whom you can show this kind of love. You are going to
have a great Monday!
