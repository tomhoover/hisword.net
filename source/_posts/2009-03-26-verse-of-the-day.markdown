_Jeremiah 31:3  
The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved
thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I
drawn thee._

In our verse it says that "God loves you with an everlasting love!"
This is a love that will not end. God knows your besetting sin, and
yet He says you are secure in His love. This love isn't based upon
your performance. That ought to make you smile and give you the
desire to tell someone about such great love!
