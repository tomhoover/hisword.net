_Haggai 2:4b  
Be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for
I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts._

Is there something you have been thinking about doing for God, but
you just don't think you are capable of doing it? With God as your
partner, you can accomplish much more than you think. The key is
remembering that He is working right beside you and you are not
alone.
