title: March 3rd - God&rsquo;s Place of Promise
---

_II Corinthians 7:1  
Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God._

It&rsquo;s laundry day, time to get clean! It&rsquo;s time to ask
God to reveal your sin and anything that destroys your fellowship
with Him. Those stubborn sins you hold on to, block your fellowship
with God, and keep you from experiencing His goodness.
