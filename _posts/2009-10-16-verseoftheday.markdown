title: October 16th - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_I John 3:11  
For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we
should love one another._

We must prepare our hearts every day if we are going to have the
"Extreme LOVE" for others that we should have. Your attitudes and
actions toward others will preach a message louder than your words.
If you are mindful of your example of love to all people, it will
make a difference in your day! Extreme Love! Do you have it?
