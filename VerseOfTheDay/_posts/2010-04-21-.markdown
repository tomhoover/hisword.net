title: April 21st - Extreme Love...works at overcoming anger.
---

_Proverbs 22:24  
Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou
shalt not go._

There are some relationships that are just not good for you. If you
are constantly around a friend who is always angry and exploding, the
venom will get on you eventually. Are Christians to break off their
relationship with people like this? Pray for them and ask God to
direct your course of action. According to our verse, if they won't
change, you are in danger if you remain too close to them. Trust
God's wisdom, but be open to God doing what you cannot.
