title: October 26th - The Basics of Partnership
---

_Psalm 57:2  
I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things
for me._

Why is it we can forget to call upon God, until we are at the point
of despair? Why don't we call upon God on a good day and include Him
then? Wherever you find yourself today, don't overlook an opportunity
to stop and praise His name! Every day is a good day when He's your
partner.
