_Romans 8:26  
Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not
what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh
intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered._

There are times when you don't know how or what to pray about a
situation! You don't know what is best, and you don't even know how
to express those thoughts in words. The Holy Spirit can translate the
sighs of your heart into the right words before God's throne. It is
comforting that you don't always have to know what to pray. That's
your Partner's job. Your job is to share your heart with Him, and He
will do the translating.
