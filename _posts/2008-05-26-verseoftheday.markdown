title: May 26th - God&rsquo;s Place of Victory
---

_Psalm 35:1  
Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against
them that fight against me._

This psalm was written by David when he was running from King Saul.
David understood that God was at work in King Saul&rsquo;s life, as
well as his own. Whatever situation you find yourself in today, take
comfort in knowing that God has more than one agenda. He sees the big
picture and knows best how to take care of His children!
