_Matthew 11:28-30  
Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give
you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke
is easy, and my burden is light._

REST? Doesn't that sound good, or does it? It will require FAITH on
your part to REST, when everything inside you is screaming, "help me
now!" When you are burdened down, you don't want to be put on God's
waiting list. Our verse reminds us that there is a necessary exchange
if you want REST! You will have to give your burden to God, and in
obedience let Him do His part. FAITH is releasing your hold, and when
you do that, you will be RESTING in God!
