title: December 13th - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_Psalm 42:4  
When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had
gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with
the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday._

It's Sunday! Get up out of bed and prepare your heart to worship
the Lord. One of the ways you can do this is by singing a song of
praise to the Lord, or by taking a moment to rehearse all God's
wonderful attributes. When you get to church, pour out your heart to
the Lord, as our verse says, with joyful praise! God's looking down
and listening for YOUR praise!
