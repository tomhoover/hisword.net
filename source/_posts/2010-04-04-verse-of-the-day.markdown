_John 20:21  
Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath
sent me, even so send I you._

Jesus could have become angry with His disciples, after all, they
all forsook Him. After the resurrection, the disciples hid in an
upper room for fear of their lives. Jesus seeks them out, and instead
of being angry with the disciples, the first thing He does is to
assure them of His Extreme Love. He says, "Peace be unto you." The
power of the resurrection delivers overcoming LOVE!! May this
overcoming power of LOVE rule in your life today and always!
