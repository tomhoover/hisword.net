title: October 7th - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_I Peter 2:20  
For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye
shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it,
ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God._

You may be weary today of doing the "right thing," and suffering
for it. Don't be discouraged! Your righteous Judge will one day set
the record straight for you. In the meantime, it's like interest
accruing in the bank. Pay day is coming, and your life investment
will reap patience's reward, one day soon.
