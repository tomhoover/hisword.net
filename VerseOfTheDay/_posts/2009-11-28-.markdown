title: November 28th - Extreme Love...Is Kind
---

_Psalm 37:3  
Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and
verily thou shalt be fed._

Sometimes we want to be sure of a thing, or we won't do it. Would
your dependency upon God change if you could see Him? In our verse,
we are told to trust God and do the right thing, and then He will
come through for us. God wants to bless you a lot more than you can
imagine... if you would only trust Him, when you can't see Him!
