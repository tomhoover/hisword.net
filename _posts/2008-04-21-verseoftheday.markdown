title: April 21st- God&rsquo;s Place of Care
---

_Philippians 1:6  
Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good
work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ._

God&rsquo;s got a job for you today! In the course of your day, the
living God will bring people into your life, who need to know that
there really is a God who loves and cares about them. Look for an
opportunity to represent God today!
