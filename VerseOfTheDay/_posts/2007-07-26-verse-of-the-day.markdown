_Ephesians 5:8  
For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord:
walk as children of light._

Paul, in Ephesians, deals with where we were before being saved,
and where we are now in the light of salvation in Christ. When we
were in darkness we served the flesh with its lusts and pleasures,
but now we have the light - the wisdom and teaching which comes from
God, both within, from the Spirit, and without, from the Bible and
the church; therefore walk as children of the light. Let the world
see that ye are not slaves to the flesh, but free, willing, and
rational servants of Jesus Christ.
