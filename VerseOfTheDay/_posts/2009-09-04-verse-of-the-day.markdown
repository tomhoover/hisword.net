_Ephesians 5:27  
That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having
spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and
without blemish._

If your clothes are dirty or wrinkled, you clean them up. Your
service to the Lord's church can need cleansing every so often also.
Ask God to cleanse you and renew a holy reverence in your heart, for
His house. John Wesley said, /"The church recruited people who were
starched and ironed before they were washed."/
