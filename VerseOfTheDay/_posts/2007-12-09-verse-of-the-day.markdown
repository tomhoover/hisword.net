_Ephesians 5:2  
And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given
himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling
savour._

Are the "smells of Christmas" in your home? The smell of candies,
pies, and cookies make us think of Christmas. When you show love in a
world of hate, this becomes a sweetsmelling sacrifice to God. Be
determined to love the person in front of you today, no matter who it
is.
