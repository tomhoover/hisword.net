_Psalm 9:10  
And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou,
Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee._

Do you ever feel like you are all alone and no one really cares
about you? Negative thoughts like this can come into your mind, when
you haven't spent enough time with the Lord. If you will read His
Word, the Holy Spirit will speak to you and assure you that God is
with you and you are never alone. Connect with God and get the
victory over your emotions.
