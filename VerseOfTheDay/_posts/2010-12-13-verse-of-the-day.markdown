_Proverbs 4:18  
But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more
and more unto the perfect day._

The Christmas season gives the Christian so many opportunities to
be a FAITH LIGHT! Think of yourself as being like that "night-light"
you have in your hallway, that shows you where to go. When you are
kind to the unlovely, when you are giving to the needy, when you are
merciful to the ungrateful, then you have become a FAITH LIGHT! You
are showing others that the LIGHT of God is all around them.
