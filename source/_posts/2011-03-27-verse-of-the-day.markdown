_Psalm 90:1  
Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations._

David is praising the Lord for His FAITHfulness to every generation
that has dwelt on this earth. Charles Spurgeon said, "Wash your face
every morning in a bath of praise." Praise is a positive expression
of FAITH! It sets your attitude to dwell on things above! Take a
moment and praise God for all the blessings in your life.
