title: October 22nd - Extreme Love...Is Patient
---

_James 5:7  
Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold,
the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath
long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain._

Have you listened closely to the news lately? There are wars and
rumors of wars. There are economic problems on every front. There are
natural disasters on every continent. There are problems in every
home. Why won't You come get Your children, Lord? We are ready!
That's when our verse reminds us, that we may be ready, but there are
some who aren't ready and don't know Jesus as their Savior! Use me
today, Lord, to patiently tell my friend one more time of your
"Extreme LOVE" for sinners!
