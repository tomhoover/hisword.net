_Psalm 105:4  
Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore._

Here we are at the end of another month. Have you downloaded any
APPS this month? Has your FAITH been challenged, and are you growing
stronger in your FAITH? Your answer will depend upon your investment.
If you seek the LORD, He will download His strength in your life. Our

continual download!! Take the time to strengthen your FAITH every
day! It's YOUR move!
