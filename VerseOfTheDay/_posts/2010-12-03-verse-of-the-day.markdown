_Isaiah 9:2  
The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they
that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the
light shined._

As we get up and start our day, we don't often think about the fact
that we are living in the land of the shadow of death. That is such a
negative thought, but it is necessary if you are to see the LIGHT of
God's goodness in your life. Francis Bacon said, "In order for the
light to shine so brightly, the darkness must be present." FAITH in
God becomes a great LIGHT that will shine in this dark world! May
your face reflect HIS LIGHT today!
