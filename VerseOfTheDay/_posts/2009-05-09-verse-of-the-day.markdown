_Philippians 2:5  
Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus._

When Jesus was upon the earth, His mind continually thought upon
others and His part in helping them to be reconciled to His Father.
If you are going to have His mind-set today, you must not focus on
yourself, but others! You will probably find yourself in a situation
today where you will have to choose between pleasing yourself or
someone else. Prepare your heart to be like Jesus and ask for your
Partner's help!
