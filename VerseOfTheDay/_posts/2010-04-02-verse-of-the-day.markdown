title: April 2nd - Extreme Love...works at overcoming anger.
---

_Mark 15:3  
And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered
nothing._

Easter is a time when we primarily focus upon the "the
resurrection" of Jesus from the grave. Jesus died on the cross and
freely gave his blood for the sins of mankind. Every person must
embrace this truth, individually, if they are to have eternal life.
Jesus' life on earth was also an example of truth for our everyday
lives. In our verse, He showed us that you don't have to get angry
and defend yourself when you are treated unjustly. When you keep
silent, the truth eventually defends and justifies itself. Be
encouraged, the Truth is still able to set you free!
