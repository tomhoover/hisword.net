title: April 28th- God&rsquo;s Place of Care
---

_Psalm 27:13  
I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD
in the land of the living._

It is most comforting to think that heaven will be so much better
than anything on this earth. Today might be one of those days when
you might faint, if you don&rsquo;t focus on the Lord&rsquo;s
goodness in your life. God cares!
