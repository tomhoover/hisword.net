_Isaiah 28:16  
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a
foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure
foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste._

The meaning of "not make haste" is to flee in hasty alarm, or to be
ashamed, or to be confounded. He who rests on and in God shall not
have the strife of confusion and doubt, nor flee in sudden panic. A
believer needs to be firmly rooted on the foundation stone that is
Jesus Christ and Him alone. If not, then the believer is in grave
danger of being tossed about to and fro from sound doctrine, fleeing
from God&rsquo;s truth at the slightest tempest of the tempter.
