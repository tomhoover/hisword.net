title: June 17th - Extreme Love...rejoices in truth.
---

_Proverbs 17:17  
A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity._

How many times does a friend forgive another friend? The disciples
asked Jesus a similar question. In response, Jesus told them, you
must forgive over and over. When this principle is applied to
friends, it is twice as important. We all have trials and problems,
and if there is anyone who should be understanding and forgiving, it
should be a friend. If you aren't perfect, why should you expect
other people to be perfect? EXTREME LOVE!
