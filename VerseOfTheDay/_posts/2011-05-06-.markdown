_Psalm 91:14  
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him:
I will set him on high, because he hath known my name._

This is a very personal verse. If you are ever been going through a
hard time in your life, and feel like you are drowning, it will speak
to you, IF you personalize it. Deliverance comes when you give up the
struggle, stop beating the water, and cling to GOD. That is the way
that all drowning people are rescued! Personalize this verse and take
it with you today!
