_James 1:26  
If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his
tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain._

As a fool would carelessly play with or point a loaded gun, so many
Christians today do likewise with their deadly tongue. If only we
could fully realize the untold damage that we are doing to the body
of Christ! If only we could see the full effect of the words we use!
As a Christian you are representing Christ and His body, the local
church. May you think twice before you speak once!
