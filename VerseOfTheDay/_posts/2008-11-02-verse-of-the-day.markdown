title: November 2nd - Partnership with God in Prayer
---

_Psalm 88:1-2  
1 O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before Thee:  
2 Let my prayer come before Thee: incline Thine ear unto my cry._

Imagine that you are sitting on a bench and God is right beside
you. You have God all to yourself and you can have a conversation
with Him about anything. What would you say? Would your heart swell
and your eyes fill with tears as you thank and praise Him for your
salvation? Would you openly share your heavy burdens and needs? If
you have asked Jesus Christ into your heart, He is with you as
pictured, and He's longing to share such an intimate moment with you.
His ear is listening for YOUR voice.
