_Isaiah 12:2  
Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for
the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my
salvation._

Someone said that out of every life experience they have had, God
has given them a song. It's not an audible song, it's more like a
marker. The LORD JEHOVAH cares for His children not once, but
continually. Each time He delivers you and strengthens you, mark that
moment. Let your praise for His deliverance manifest itself in song,
when you sing to your Creator. You are blessed Christian! Live like
it today!
