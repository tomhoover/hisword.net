_Revelation 2:26-28  
26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him
will I give power over the nations:  
27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a
potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my
Father.  
28 And I will give him the morning star._

We are sure of heaven by faith in Christ. We are overcomers if we
allow Christ to be the Lord of our lives here, thereby living a life
of faithfulness and obedience according to the Word of God. Believers
have a great "reward of the inheritance" to look forward to, but the
greatest part of that reward is verse 28 above. In some special way,
God will reward your obedient life of faith with the special,
intimate gift of the "morning star." The "morning star" is Jesus
Christ Himself! (see Rev.22:16)
