_Acts 17:28a  
For in Him we live, and move, and have our being._

Don't go out there in that evil cruel world without being focused
on God's presence in your life. When you mentally establish that you
live and do everything for Him, it will give your day new purpose and
direction. Live focused upon Him today! It's the best way!
