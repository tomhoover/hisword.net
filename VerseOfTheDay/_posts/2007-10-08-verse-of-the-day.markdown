_I Timothy 6:17  
Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who
giveth us richly all things to enjoy._

Purpose to trust God today and count your spiritual blessings,
instead of thinking about what you don&rsquo;t have!
