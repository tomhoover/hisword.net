_Colossians 1:10-11  
That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto
all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness._

The only thing worse than not having any patience, is having
patience, and being mad about having to have it! God not only asks
for you to have patience, but He wants you to have joyful patience!
Now, that's EXTREME! If you are going to have this kind of patience
you will need to be strengthened by the Lord! Better get on your
knees before you go any further. You need HIS help!
