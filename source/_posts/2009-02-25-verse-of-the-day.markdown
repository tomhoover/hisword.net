_I Thessalonians 5:11  
Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even
as also ye do._

Hello! What are you going to do with your life today? Will you
invest it in encouraging one of God's children? If you should chose
this investment today, your Partner would help you and God will see
that you get blessed in the process.
