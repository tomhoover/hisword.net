_Hebrews 11:6  
But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh
to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
diligently seek him._

God is asking YOU to make up YOUR mind! Do you believe in the God
of the Bible, whom you haven&rsquo;t seen? Do you believe that He
created the Universe, and sent His Son from heaven to earth to
demonstrate His love? Do you believe that sin separates mankind from
God? Have you asked Jesus to forgive your sins and come into your
heart? If you answered "yes" to all the above questions, your FAITH
has been launched, and God is pleased. These questions, properly
answered, will initiate believing in what you cannot see, and resting
your FAITH in God for your salvation. It's time to make up YOUR
mind!
