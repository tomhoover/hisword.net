_Isaiah 49:10  
They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun
smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by
the springs of water shall he guide them._

Hello! Do you need someone to remind you that God cares about you
more than you could ever imagine? Every time you drink water today,
stop and thank God for His &ldquo;living water&rdquo;, and every
earthly provision.
