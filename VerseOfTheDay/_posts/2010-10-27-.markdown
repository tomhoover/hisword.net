_II Timothy 1:5  
When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee,
which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and
I am persuaded that in thee also._

Everyone comes into this world with a family! Stop and think about
your family. God placed people in families knowing each person's need
of love, support, encouragement, and FAITH. In our verse you can see
the product of an imperfect, yet loving family. Timothy saw the FAITH
of his mother and grandmother, and it launched a FAITH in his own
life. Are you helping your family "launch" their FAITH in God? Would
your family say you are "FULL of FAITH?" Ask God to help you be a
symbol of FAITH to your family.
