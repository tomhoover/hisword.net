_I Corinthians 2:16  
For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?
But we have the mind of Christ._

Don't you just wish you could call Jesus Christ up on a phone and
have a direct line to speak with Him? What instruction would you ask
of Him? In our verse, Paul reminds us that the WORDS of Christ have
been given to us for every situation that we might face in this
lifetime. EVERY SITUATION? Yes! Ask the Holy Spirit to help you
understand, more completely, the mind of Christ, and to have a deeper
FAITH in Him.
