_Psalm 118:14  
The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation._

Singing is helpful for patients with dementia, according to a
British study, and many experts suspect that such activities may
delay memory problems. Singing provides some great health benefits!
You can double that benefit, if you are singing praises to God's
name! SING!
