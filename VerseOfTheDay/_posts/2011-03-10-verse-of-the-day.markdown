_Hebrews 11:12  
Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many
as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the
sea shore innumerable._

It's happened! The present estimate of the earth's population is
over 70 billion, with three more added every three seconds. Never
would Abraham have imagined that so many people would be affected as
a result of his FAITH in God! God is still using people who will have
the FAITH to trust Him with their lives! Will you tell someone about
salvation that comes through Jesus Christ today? There are billions
of people who need one person to care about them!
