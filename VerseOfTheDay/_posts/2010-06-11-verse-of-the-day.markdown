title: June 11th - Extreme Love...rejoices in truth.

_John 14:6  
Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man
cometh unto the Father, but by me._

Are you looking for purpose and direction for your life? There is
ONE way! Are you searching for some answers about the world and your
existence? There is ONE TRUTH! Do wonder if this world is all there
is? There is ONE eternal life! These questions are all answered in
JESUS CHRIST, and Him alone! Someone said, "Truth sits upon the lips
of dying men!" For Christians, TRUTH is more than genuine honesty
that comes at the point of death. TRUTH is the answer for death!
Jesus rose from the grave and promised the same for those who believe
in Him.
