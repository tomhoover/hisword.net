_II Timothy 2:3  
Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ._

"Be strong! We are not here to play, to dream, to drift,
We have hard work to do, and loads to lift.
Shun not the struggle, face it, 'tis God's gift.
Be strong! Say not the days are evil - who's to blame?
And fold the hands and acquiesce - O shame.
Stand up, speak out, with FAITH, in God's name!
Be strong! It matters not how deep-entrenched the wrong,
how hard the battle goes, the day how long,
Faint not, fight on! Tomorrow comes the song." - M.D. Babcock
