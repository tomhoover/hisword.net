_I Corinthians 15:17  
And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your
sins._

"What if?" This is the negative phrase used every day by the enemy
to plant doubts in the minds of humanity! This is one time when the
past can really help you see your present and future in a positive
way! In our verse, God wants everyone to know, there are no "ifs!"
Jesus Christ was raised from the grave! There were over 500
witnesses! Jesus did die, on the cross, for the sins of the world!
The changed life of those who believe cannot be denied! The "if"
applies to your FAITH, not the supposition of what Jesus Christ did!
Your FAITH is not in vain! It will be rewarded with sight, IF you
believe in Him! FAITH LIFT!
