title: November 29th - Extreme Love...Is Kind
---

_Matthew 5:39  
But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall
smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also._

Now that has got to be one of the most EXTREME verses in the Bible!
Who would put up with someone slapping them in the face, and ask them
to do it again? Someone who wants to show the EXTREME LOVE of God to
a lost world, will do that very thing! You may not be "slapped" on
the face today, but you may be "scorched" with unkind words. Will you
come back and be kind to them anyway?!
