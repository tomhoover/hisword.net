_Psalm 25:18  
Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins._

There is an old Proverb that says, "Forgiveness is the fragrance of
the violet which still clings fast to the heel that crushed it." If
you are hurting in some way today, look for the beauty of God's
forgiveness in your life. Refocusing your thoughts on the God who is
faithful to forgive, can result in joy and pain management.
