_Ephesians 2:8  
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves:
it is the gift of God._

God's not looking for you to do good things in order to be saved.
All God asks of you is that you repent of your sins, and put your
FAITH in Him. When you do this, your salvation through FAITH has been
launched. You are resting your eternal destiny in the arms of God, and
letting Him work out the details. This gift of salvation continues to
be a part of your Christian life. If you will give your everyday
problems and situations to Him, He will again handle the details,
saving you from the entanglements of this life. Celebrate! God's
given you a "GIFT" today! FAITH!
