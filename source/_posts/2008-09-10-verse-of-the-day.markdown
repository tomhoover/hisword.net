_Psalm 107:2  
Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the
hand of the enemy._

You need to tell someone today about the peace that comes through
God's forgiveness of sins. There are lots of "sick" people in this
world, who need a cure. If you don't point them to the "Healer", who
will?
