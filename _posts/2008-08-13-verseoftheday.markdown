title: August 13th - God&rsquo;s Place of Faithfulness
---

_Proverbs 28:20  
A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste
to be rich shall not be innocent._

We are blessed when we have the proper attitude of being faithful
to give to God. We don&rsquo;t give to God to receive His blessing;
but we should give because we want to honor Him and be obedient. Is
God blessing you? Check your attitude toward God.
