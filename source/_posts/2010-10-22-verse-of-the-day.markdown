_Galatians 3:9  
So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham._

Abraham was a human being, just like us! He was not always FULL of
FAITH! Abraham had a weakness in the area of fearing man. God
mercifully showed Abraham that He could deliver him from this fear of
man. Through these failed FAITH lessons, Abraham's FAITH relationship
with God grew and eventually FAITH filled his daily life. We are
blessed today, because of Abraham's FAITH. Don't be discouraged if
you have a few set backs in your FAITH, just learn from them. Your
life could make the difference in future generations! Be FULL of
FAITH!
