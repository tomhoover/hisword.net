_Colossians 1:10-11  
That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;
Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto
all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness._

The Bible talks about infant FAITH, mature FAITH, and all kinds of
FAITH in between. Your walk of FAITH with the LORD, shouldn't just be
status quo, but it should be increasing and growing stronger every
day. The best part about this is, you have help. You can have God's
POWER appropriated through prayer. God provides the LIFT, but you
must apply yourself and patiently learn of Him. FAITH-LIFT!
