_John 16:13  
Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he
shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to
come._

Why go to a good church? Because a special ministry of the Holy
Spirit is to teach God's truth there (cf. 1 Tim 3:15), which truth we
need for guidance. He also promises us that He would reveal things to
come, which promise God kept through the writings of the New
Testament writers to His churches. In a world of pseudo-Biblical
teaching, God&rsquo;s children need a church where God&rsquo;s
guiding truth is taught without compromise.
