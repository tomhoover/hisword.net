_Psalm 125:1  
They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be
removed, but abideth for ever._

Mount Zion is pictured as an image of "eternal steadfastness." This
mountain near Jerusalem which, according to the Hebrew, "sits to
eternity," can not move. Charles Spurgeon said, "Faith in God is a
settling and establishing virtue; He who by His strength setteth fast
the mountains, by that same power stays the hearts of them that trust
in Him." Put a smile on your face, if you are a believer, you are
secure and will live for eternity with God!
