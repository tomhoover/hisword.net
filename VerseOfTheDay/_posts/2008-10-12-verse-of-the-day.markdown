_Colossians 3:22-23  
22 Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh,
not with eyeservice as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart,
fearing God:  
23 And whatsoever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not
unto men._

Going to church week after week can become more of a habit than a
real desire of your heart. Make today different. When you sing, sing
with all your heart to God, and don't worry about what people think.
Listen to the sermon and imagine it's God speaking directly to you,
and no one else. Be obedient to do what God tells you to do. It will
make Monday a better day.
