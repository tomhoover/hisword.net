_Psalm 54:7  
For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen
his desire upon mine enemies._

Every day is a good day to praise the Lord! In our verse, David is
reflecting upon the many times that God delivered him out of trouble!
What has God done for you in the past? Has He been FAITHFULL? Can you
ever thank Him and praise Him too much? If not, then right now,
"thank God out loud!" We praise you Lord for deliverance!
