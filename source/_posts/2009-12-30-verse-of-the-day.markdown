_I John 4:19  
We love him, because he first loved us._

There can be days when you think "nobody loves you or cares about
you." These are just some of the lies that Satan would like for you
to believe. For the record, God loves each and every person, and He
declares it over and over in the Bible. It is because He loved us
first, that we can feel so secure in His love. That's Extreme
Love&ndash; taking the initiative! Could you love someone who doesn't
love you today?
