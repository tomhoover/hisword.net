title: April 24th - Partnership with God for a Victorious Life
---

_Psalm 46:1-2  
1 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.  
2 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea._

God always promises a safe landing, but that doesn't mean you will
always have a calm passage. God is your help in every trouble. He
keeps you secure in His care, so that not even the strongest force on
this earth can harm you. When you start to feel overwhelmed by
trouble, recall God's promise and renew your faith and strength.
