_Ephesians 5:20  
Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ._

Are you supposed to give thanks ALWAYS for ALL things? The "all"
part, is the probably the last place we want to put any emphasis. It
can be hard to thank God for our problems, trials, and discomforts.
Most of the time, it is only when we are on the other side of these
uncomfortable areas of our lives, that we are more able to "give
thanks." This verse could be giving you a "fast forward," if you
would just "give thanks" ALWAYS at ALL times. Thank you, Jesus!
