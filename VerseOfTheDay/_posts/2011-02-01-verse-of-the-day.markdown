title: February 1st - FaithForce...engaging your faith in Spiritual
---

_Romans 13:12  
The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast
off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light._

If there was ever a day when you need to keep your heart, it is
today! There is a spiritual battle going on to allure Christians away
from the LIGHT, Jesus Christ. Ask yourself this question, "What is the
most important thing I can do today, in light of eternity?" Whatever
your answer, clothe yourself in the armor of prayer, asking for God's
empowerment. You are in the midst of a spiritual war and you need
God's help, to be a soldier, who is FULL of FAITH!
