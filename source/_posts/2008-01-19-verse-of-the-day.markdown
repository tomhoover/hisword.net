_Psalm 21:13  
Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and
praise thy power._

j "Would you be free from the burden of sin? There is power in the
blood, power in the blood. Would you over evil a victory win?
There&rsquo;s wonderful power in the blood. In the precious blood of
the Lamb." SING IT! l
