_I Chronicles 29:17a  
I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure
in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have
willingly offered all these things..._

When your heart is right with God, you will want to do the things
that you know please Him. One of the things that pleases Him most, is
when you spend time with Him, and talk to Him in prayer. Our verse is
part of a prayer. Frederick Wisloff said, "You may pray for an hour
and still not pray, or you may meet God for a moment and then be in
touch with Him all day." What will it be for you today?
