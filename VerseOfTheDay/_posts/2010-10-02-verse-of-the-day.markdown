_Hebrews 11:1  
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen._

FAITH is defined through a commitment of your will to believe in
God's existence, even though you cannot see Him with your human eye.
It is choosing to see and embrace Him with a spiritual eye. This
powerful God of the Bible, in turn, through Faith, gives a sure HOPE,
to the believer, of being able to dwell with Him in an eternal world
beyond this life. Do you believe? If you already have this FAITH,
share your life changing FAITH with someone else today!
