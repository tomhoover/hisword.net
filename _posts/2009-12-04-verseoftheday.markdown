title: December 4th - Extreme Love...Is Joyous, not Jealous
---

_Philippians 2:17  
Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your
faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all._

One of the sweetest things about this time of the year is being
able to serve others and show God's love to them. This will bring
some real "JOY" to your life if kept in the RIGHT order: 

**J**_esus_  
**O**_thers_  
**Y**_ou_

Share a "JOYFUL" expression with everyone you meet
today. It will be the least expensive gift on your Christmas list,
but it will be priceless for those who receive it.
