title: February 20th - Extreme Love...is gracious, not rude.
---

_Psalm 34:13  
Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile._

Charles Spurgeon said, "Men cannot spit forth venom, without
feeling some of the poison burning their own flesh." If you want to
be miserable, speak evil about someone. No matter how rude people can
be to you, if you will keep yourself from speaking bad about them,
they have lost and God has won! Don't talk bad about others unless
you want to be miserable.
