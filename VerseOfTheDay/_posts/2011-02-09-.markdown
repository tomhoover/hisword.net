_II Corinthians 10:5  
Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself
against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every
thought to the obedience of Christ._

You are living in a battle zone every day whether you realize it or
not! Every day Satan floods the air waves with evil, trying to entice
Christians away from serving the Holy God. The sad part is that most
Christians not only aren't prepared for battle, they aren't even
mindful that there is a battle being fought for their lives! The
verse today reminds us that it is in our MINDS where the battle is
first fought. Remember, the Almighty Powerful God knows not only what
you think, but what you do! Delete those evil thoughts!
