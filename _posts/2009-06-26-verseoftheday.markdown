title: June 26th - Partnership with God in Adventures of Faith
---

_Psalm 34:22  
The Lord redeemeth the soul of His servants: and none of them that
trust in Him shall be desolate._

Servants usually aren't given much consideration. They are expected
to do their job whether they are rewarded or not. This is FAITH at its
best&ndash; confident (in God) without consolation or retribution
(seeing your reward.) God has made a promise to His faithful,
trusting servants , that they will see their reward one day! Until
then...we live in the confidence of His FAITHFUL promises!
