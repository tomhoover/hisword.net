title: November 21st - Partnership with God in Prayer
---

_Psalm 69:16  
Hear me, O Lord; for Thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me
according to the multitude of Thy tender mercies._

Prayer is one of the best ways we have to remind ourselves that God
is our gracious heavenly Father and that we are His much-loved
children. Take a moment to thank God for all the times He mercifully
answered your prayers. God has been so good to you. Take that prayer
and let it put a smile on your face and a change in your attitude.
