_Psalm 27:1  
The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD
is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?_

"No matter how fast light travels it finds that the darkness has
always got there first, and it is waiting for it!" &ndash;T.
Pratchett. Darkness take notice! The LORD is the strength of my life
and I will not fear! I Believe! Do you?
