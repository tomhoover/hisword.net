_I Corinthians 13:13  
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest
of these is charity._

Faith and hope play a very important part in your life, but where
would you be without love, God's love, in particular? God's love
supports the Universe, provides breath in your lungs, and gives
purpose for your life. Most of all, it was God's love that provided a
way to forgive your sins, and give you eternal life through His Son,
Jesus. It's the greatest! Tell someone about God's great love,
today!
