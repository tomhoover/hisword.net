_Psalm 51:17  
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite
heart, O God, thou wilt not despise._

Before you do anything else today, confess your sin to God. Touch
the throne of heaven with your prayers and tears of repentance. Pour
your heart out to God, and you will feel His Spirit connect with
yours. Joy will flood your soul!
