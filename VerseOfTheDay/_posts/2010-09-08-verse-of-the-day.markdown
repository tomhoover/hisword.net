_Psalm 18:2  
The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my
strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my
salvation, and my high tower._

Do you ever get tired of this "rat race" called life, and want to
"hide out?" If you should find yourself feeling that way, run into
your "high tower!" It's wonderful how the LORD pictures Himself as
various things in the Bible, so we can understand His character. In
our verse today, He wants you know that you can run to the "high
tower of His Presence," when you feel overwhelmed. It's that quiet
place, where you are alone with the LORD, that will strengthen your
heart!!
