_Romans 10:13  
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved._

One of the most amazing things about our God is that He loves
EVERYONE, without exception, the same. He wants
&ldquo;whosoever&rdquo;, EVERYONE, to have eternal life! If you
already have a relationship with Him, He wants you to tell all the
&ldquo;whosoevers&rdquo; in your life about Him. God will give you an
opportunity to do this today, so keep your eyes open!
