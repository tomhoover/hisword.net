_Psalm 84:11  
For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and
glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk
uprightly._

What an awesome verse! The Lord God is a sun and shield for every
believer! He is a sun that "warms you," that "gives light to your
path," and He is also a shield that "protects you" from harm. God
leads, comforts, and protects the believer. The sun is above you,
giving warmth and guidance. The shield of FAITH is around you,
providing God's grace and glory for every obstacle in your path. The
Lord has blessed you today with His presence as you are walking the
paths of this world. Reflect upon the "sun" and "shield" and the many
other blessings the heavenly Father gives you, and walk in His
righteousness!
