_Matthew 6:30  
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is,
and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall He not much more clothe ye,
O ye of little faith?_

What are you worrying about? Is there not enough time in your day
or money in your pocket? If you will focus on God, and all the times
He has provided for you in the past, your faith will be restored. Be
content with less and most of your worries will fade away.
