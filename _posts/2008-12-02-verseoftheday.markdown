title: December 2nd - Partnership with God in Personal Finances

_Proverbs 23:4  
Labor not to be rich: cease from thy own wisdom._

There are more important things in life than money and riches.
Celebrate the wonderful blessing of a relationship with Jesus Christ.
The world's riches are never secure, but a Christian's riches are
secure in Jesus Christ.
