_John 3:19  
And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil._

Even though the world enjoys the benefits of LIGHT, many won't
embrace the true LIGHT, Jesus Christ. Ralph Waldo Emerson puts it in
a thoughtful and humorous way: "The sun shines and warms and lights
us and we have no curiosity to know why this is so; but we ask the
reason of all evil, of pain, and hunger, and mosquitoes and silly
people!" May your FAITH keep you walking in the LIGHT today!
