_Psalm 119:165  
Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend
them._

What a powerful verse! Do you ever struggle with relationships? Do
you find yourself offending others, or being offended? The principle
for PEACE in relationships is found in God's WORD. If you LOVE God's
WORD and want to please Him, you will sacrifice your pride and put
others before yourself. This isn't always easy, but it is the answer
for peace in most situations. Once again, it will take FAITH on your
part to implement God's will.
