_Psalm 37:5  
Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in Him; and He shall bring
it to pass._

Spurgeon said, "Roll your whole burden of life upon the Lord." This
means you give God all the things that are pulling you down, and stop
trying to manage and work things out yourself. This means you trust
it all to the Lord and take your hands off. You must do your part,
and let God do His part. It's a partnership with guaranteed
dividends!
