_II Kings 7:1  
Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about
this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two
measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria._

It seemed like an impossible situation! Does that sound familiar?
You know, too many bills and not enough money after Christmas. Maybe
it's a relationship that seems irreparable, or a health situation
beyond medicine's intervention. Such was the case in our verse, and
God did the impossible and got the glory!! No one would have imagined
He would it do it that way! FAITH believes that GOD is still doing
miracles! Do you BELIEVE?
