_Matthew 5:16  
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven._

Not everyone is a "self-starter." In other words, sometimes we need
someone to "light a fire" under us before we can get going. This is
just another one of those wonderful things that God FAITHFULLY does
for the Christian. However, you may want to get going before He
"lights your fire." The heat from His flame can sometimes be
uncomfortable. Why not just let your light shine before others, and
tell someone about the real reason for the season today?
