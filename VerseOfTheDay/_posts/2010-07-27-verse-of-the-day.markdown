_Isaiah 46:4  
And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I
carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will
deliver you._

Statistics from the Pew Forum on Religion in Public Life seem to
indicate that with age, passion for daily prayer increases. Forty-two
percent of Gen Xers, those born between 1965-80, said they prayed
daily in the late 1990's. Now, fifty four percent of those same Gen
Xers say they pray every day. Forty seven percent of Boomers, those
born between 1946-64, said they prayed daily in the early 1980's.
Now, sixty two percent of the same Boomers, say they pray every day.
Perhaps the older we get, the more we understand our need for God to
carry us! May His promise to carry you into old age motivate you to
give all you can now and calm your fears regarding tomorrow!
