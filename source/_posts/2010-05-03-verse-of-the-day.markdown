_Luke 6 :27-28  
But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them
which hate you; Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which
despitefully use you._

What a verse for a Monday! You are given a commandment to LOVE
everyone today! This means those you like, and those you don't like.
If you will start your day spending some time in God's Word and
prayer, you will be better equipped to do this. Ask God to give you a
strong heart, one that's ready and willing to LOVE people today, as He
does.
