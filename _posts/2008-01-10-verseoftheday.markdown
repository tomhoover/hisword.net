title: January 10th - God's Place of Power
---

_Ephesians 6:10  
Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
might._

This is the tenth day in the new year. You may have made a
resolution to develop a stronger body through exercise. Use that same
discipline to increase your Bible knowledge, and spiritual strength.
