_II Corinthians 3:18  
But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the
Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by
the Spirit of the Lord._

Everyone who looks in a mirror at themselves, will see some sort of
blemish on their face. You might see wrinkles or freckles, as no one
is perfect, outside or inside. You can do something that will make a
difference on the inside of you, by conforming to the image of our
Lord Jesus Christ. Has the Holy Spirit been talking to you about
something you need to change? Ask the Lord to help you become more
like Him, and then APPLY FAITH generously throughout the day. Only in
God's mirror, will all the wrinkles disappear!
