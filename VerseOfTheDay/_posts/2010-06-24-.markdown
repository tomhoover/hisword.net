title: June 24th - Extreme Love...rejoices in truth.
---

_Romans 2:2  
But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth
against them which commit such things._

There are times in our lives when we misjudge people, and people
misjudge us. There is no way we can know all the facts, or even
assess a situation, without prejudice. At those times, it is most
comforting to know that God knows ALL of the TRUTH, and judges
righteously. You don't have to worry about what other people are
doing. Just ask God to help you LOVE more and judge less!
