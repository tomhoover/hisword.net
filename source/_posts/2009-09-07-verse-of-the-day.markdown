_Revelation 2:2a  
I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience._

In this fast paced world, you can get weary serving the Lord. This
is where it's comforting to know that God sees your heart, knows you,
and understands you. He alone can give you the strength and patience
to keep going! He alone knows all the things you do for your church,
and He will reward your service.
