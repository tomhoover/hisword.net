_Psalm 119:165  
Great peace have they that love thy law; and nothing shall offend
them._

This is the way it works! The less you get upset about, the greater
your peace and happiness will be. If you find yourself always upset or
discouraged about something in your life, consider a change in your
mind-set. You need an "attitude lift." Hasn't God promised to give
you His best, if you trust Him? Lift it up!
