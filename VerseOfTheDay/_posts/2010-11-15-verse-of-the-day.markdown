_Romans 10:17  
So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God._

At the time this verse was penned, most people depended not upon
the written Word of God, but the spoken Word of God. Today, you are
blessed to have the written Word of God that encourages and adds
assurance to your FAITH. The lives of countless individuals are
recorded, so that you can see the power of God's Word. May you be
encouraged by the FAITH of those who have gone before you. Hear God
today: "Be FULL of FAITH!"
