title: October 4th - The Basics of Partnership
---

_Micah 6:8  
He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord
require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk
humbly with thy God._

Wherever your path takes you today, be reminded that God is walking
with you. This should humble you and make you mindful of how you
interact with others. Most often it is when we are proud, that we are
so easily offended and lacking in love and mercy.
