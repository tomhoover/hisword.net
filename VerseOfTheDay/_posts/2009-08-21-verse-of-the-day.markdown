_Proverbs 20:24  
Man's goings are of the Lord; how can a man then understand his own
way?_

One of the most wonderful things about being a Christian, is that
you don't have to understand everything about life, or even God, to
have peace in your heart. Peace comes when you just trust God and
don't demand an explanation, or understanding, of whatever comes your
way. Trust God. It's the best way!
