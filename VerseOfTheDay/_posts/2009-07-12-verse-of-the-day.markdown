_Galatians 6:7  
Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap._

It's a good thing to respect God's judgment. As your Partner, God
sees and knows your heart and all that you do. He cannot be fooled,
nor can you go anywhere that He does not go. If you will remember
this today, it will protect you from evil. God will bless your
sacrifice to do good.
