_Psalm 143:8  
Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I
trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up
my soul unto thee._

How's your day going so far? Did you start the day off reflecting
upon God&rsquo;s lovingkindness in your life? When you invest time in
connecting with God's presence, your day will totally change. If you
will mentally focus upon God's arms encircling you, loving you, and
protecting you, it will change your actions. You will feel loved, and
you will be able to risk loving others in His secure arms!
