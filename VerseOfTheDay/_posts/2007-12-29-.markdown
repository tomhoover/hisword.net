_Romans 15:13  
Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost._

During the Christmas season, many people suffer depression,
rejection, failure, or anxiety. Is there any hope? God's hope is a
sure thing, built upon His faithful promises and prophecies. Speak
HOPE to someone!
