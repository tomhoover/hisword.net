_II Corinthians 2:14  
Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in
every place._

Thank God for His faithful help to overcome every trial of life.
Thank a friend who has been a special blessing to you this past
year.
