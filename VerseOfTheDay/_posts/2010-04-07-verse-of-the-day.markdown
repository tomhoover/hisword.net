_Job 5:2  
For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one._

Uncontrolled anger kills! It will foolishly hurt you and others.
Washington Irving wrote, "Great minds have purposes; little minds
have wishes. Little minds are subdued by misfortunes; great minds
rise above them." Rise above your circumstances! It's called giving
it to the Lord in prayer. Then elevate your thinking! Focus on God,
not the problem.
