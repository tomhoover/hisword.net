_Psalm 5:11  
But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them
ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that
love thy name be joyful in thee._

Imagine yourself in the middle of a war zone in Iraq. The enemy is
all around you on every side, but no one can touch you. Every time
the enemy comes close, they bounce off an invisible shield around
you. You shout for joy because someone's defending and protecting
you. If you are God's child, God is the unseen defender in your life.
When was the last time you exploded with joy, thinking about the
almighty God defending and protecting you? REJOICE!
