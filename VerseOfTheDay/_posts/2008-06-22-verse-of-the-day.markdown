title: June 22nd - God&rsquo;s Place of Peace
---

_Psalm 55:18  
He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against
me: for there were many with me._

Going to church on Sunday is a refuge for the soul from the world.
Inside the local church, there are many who will encourage you and
come along side you. They will remind you that the battle is the
Lord&rsquo;s and you are not alone!
