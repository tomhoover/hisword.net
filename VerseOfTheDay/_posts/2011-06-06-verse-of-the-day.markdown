_Psalm 116:9  
I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living._

Do you ever talk "out loud" to yourself? Today's verse makes a
declarative statement! It's like the Psalmist is making a declaration
of his FAITH! When a person talks about "their walk," it is referring
to how they live their life. Some live their lives always thinking
about what people will think about them. The Psalmist declares that
he is living his life thinking about God's opinion of him! What about
you? You may need to "talk out loud" and make a declaration of your
FAITH to God! He wants to WALK with you today!
