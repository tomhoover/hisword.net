_James 5:11  
Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the
patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is
very pitiful, and of tender mercy._

Patient people are usually happier people. They have decided to
believe God and trust Him when it comes to supplying their needs,
defending their honor, correcting injustice, and dealing with
difficult people. If you will patiently give these things to God, you
will be a happier person.
