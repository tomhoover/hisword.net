title: April 18th - Extreme Love...works at overcoming anger.
---

_Matthew 6:14  
For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will
also forgive you._

Sincere forgiveness isn't colored with expectations for the other
person to admit fault or change. Nor do you have to defend yourself
and have people understand your feelings when you forgive. Extreme
forgiveness is cutting all the strings that bind your offense and
handing them to your heavenly Father. This type of forgiveness gets
your Father's attention, and brings a closeness with your Father that
the world knows nothing about. Extreme Love forgives God's way.
