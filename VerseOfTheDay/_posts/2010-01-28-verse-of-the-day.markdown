title: January 28th - Extreme Love...Is not proud or self-focused
---

_Ecclesiastes 2:11  
Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the
labor that I had labored to do: and, behold, all was vanity and
vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun._

The world may try to convince you that there is happiness in living
a life for yourself, but time proves differently, as you will find out
when you leave this earth. The only thing you can take with you are
your works done for the Lord. All the pleasures that you spent hours
and days consumed with, will have no value beyond this earth. Make
your life count while you have breath!
