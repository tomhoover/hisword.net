_Romans 12:10  
Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour
preferring one another._

Brotherly love is about the kindness and love that one Christian
should show toward another Christian. You don't have to agree one
hundred per cent with another Christian to love them. In fact, the
only thing we are commanded to do is, to "love them!" Is there a
fellow Christian in your life to whom you need to show love and
kindness today?
