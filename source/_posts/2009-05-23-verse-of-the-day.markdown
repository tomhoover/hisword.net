_Proverbs 16:20  
He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good; and whoso trusteth
in the Lord, happy is he._

That was easy for Solomon to say, but what about you? How do you
know if you are handling something wisely? If you are following and
obeying God's commandments that He's given in His word, you will be
wise and happy. The happiness comes when you give up YOUR struggle,
and TRUST the timing and details to Him.
