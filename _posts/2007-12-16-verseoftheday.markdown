title: December 16th - God's Place of Provision

_Malachi 3:10  
Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat
in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if
I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a
blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it._

If you give to others, and don't give anything to God, you've
missed Christmas! What are you planning to give to God?
