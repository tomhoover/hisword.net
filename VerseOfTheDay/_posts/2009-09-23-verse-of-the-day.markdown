_Psalm 84:10  
For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a
doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of
wickedness._

What are you doing today? It doesn't matter who you are or how
important you are. One day spent with God is better than a thousand
days of the most important earthly work. Order your day, where you
can spend some time talking to God. It's the most important thing you
can do today!
