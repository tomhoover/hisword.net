title: September 7th - God's Place of Forgiveness
---

_Isaiah 1:18  
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your
sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be
red like crimson, they shall be white as snow._

God wants a close relationship with you. When there is unconfessed
sin in your life, God can seem very distant. God stands with arms
wide open, giving you an invitation to come and talk with Him at any
time. He wants to take the "dark" things in your life and replace
them with His "light." "Come, now!" says the Lord.
