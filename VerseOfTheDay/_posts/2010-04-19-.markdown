title: April 19th - Extreme Love...works at overcoming anger.
---

_Proverbs 16:32  
He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that
ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city._

One of the tactics of the evil one, is to make sure you focus on
all the wrong things in your life, rather than the good. Every time
there is a door shut in your life through adversity or problems, God
will also open a door for your deliverance. If you respond with
anger, you will never see what "love" could have accomplished. When
you embrace God's goodness, anger leaves the room.
