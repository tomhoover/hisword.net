_Psalm 40:11  
Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy
lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me._

Anybody need some mercy today? The best way to access God's mercy
is to ask for it. After you have received God's mercy in your life,
be sure and give some of it to those who might have hurt your
feelings, offended you, or misunderstood your actions.
Kindness is mercy in action.
