_John 8:36  
If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free
indeed._

The imputed righteousness of Christ, justification by faith,
salvation by grace, through faith; all of these great Bible phrases
describe the freedom from the power and bondage of sin that can only
be found by faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ our Lord on
the cross. But it is the fact of Jesus' resurrection that inspired
the words of Paul in 1 Cor. 15: /"O death, where is thy sting? O
grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the
strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."/
