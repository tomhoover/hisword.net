_Psalm 34:4  
I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my
fears._

What are the fears in your life? Is it the fear of failure,
rejection, poverty, or death? God has the answer for every one of the
fears in your life! He can handle them where you can not! After all,
if He made the universe and breathed life into man, don't you think
He can handle the necessities for sustaining this life? It's really
quite a relief to give your fears to the Lord. It might make you want
to smile, or even laugh out loud, when His peace comes back into your
soul! Lighten your load, and SMILE !
