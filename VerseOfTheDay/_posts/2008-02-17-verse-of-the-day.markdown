title: February 17th - God's Place of Presence
---

_Psalm 146:8  
The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that
are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous._

Church is a great place for God to open your eyes. Only those who
have a humble heart to receive His word, will see Him. Pray and
prepare your heart for God to speak to you and others.
